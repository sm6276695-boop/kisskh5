00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:16.629
I wondered who it was.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.660
Turns out it's you,
that useless live-in husband.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.549
Trying to play hero, huh?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.420
Want to do a hero rescue?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.909
Idiot!

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.660
My boss is talking to you.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.709
Pretending to be deaf?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.500
Speak!

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.629
Pretending you can't talk?

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.749
I'll smash you!

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.860
Hey!

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.820
Is it your turn to speak?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.660
Trying to be a hero, huh?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.189
Fine.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.660
But first, I need to ask
my big bone if it agrees.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.069
Boss!

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.509
Are you okay, boss?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.140
Boss!

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060
Whoa, boss!

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.260
Who attacked me just now?

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.789
Was it you?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.989
Was it you?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.060
I didn't see.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.420
It was him.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.909
Hey, slow down!

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.060
Ah!

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.540
Move aside!

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.420
Pretty boy!

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.980
Did you sneak attack me just now?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.780
He didn't move!

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.789
Not a bit?

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.980
Not at all.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.140
Not at all.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.069
Could be a turtle.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.500
Boss!

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.620
Qingfeng Stronghold may have
other experts.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.420
Other experts?

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.780
Go back and cook it.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.460
It's still edible.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.060
Retreat!

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.620
Li Chengyu.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.780
Who?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.949
Who exactly attacked me today?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.780
Who was it?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.269
How could I not see?

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.060
Impossible!

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.780
I will find out.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.940
I will tear him to pieces.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.229
Boss, how's Chengyu?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.660
I'll take care of him here.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.580
Go use the backup water
and cook some mung bean soup.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.669
Detox the others first.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.580
Got it.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.500
Taking care of me
while being sick yourself.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.340
Li Chengyu.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.100
Thank you.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.460
Thanks.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.429
So many herbs, which one is it?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.780
Which one?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.940
Take this one.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.632
(Dried Tangerine Peel)

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.260
Get up and take your medicine.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.940
Feeling better?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.820
It's working.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.260
All good now?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.580
Should be fine.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.020
So hot.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.260
Why is it so hot?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.060
You okay?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.700
Li Chengyu.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.020
Too hot!

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.060
What did you make me drink?

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.229
I just followed the recipe you gave me.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.380
It's right there.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.580
Step aside.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.620
Move.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.020
What do you mean, move?

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.380
Fine, moving!

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.060
Hey.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.580
I am a gentleman.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.109
No, you're serious.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.269
Testing me.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.140
Definitely testing me.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.940
Jerk!

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.700
I'll make you pay with blood!

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.340
You might not believe this.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.940
Sometimes,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.580
I don't even know who I am.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.940
Years ago, I fell into a river
and lost my memory.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.460
I woke up at Shihou Stronghold.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.460
It was a den of demons.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.220
A nightmare.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.340
I heard from the Forth Leader
about everything before.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.220
It was you who drove away Liu Pitang.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.820
How did you do it?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.980
I...

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.740
I poisoned them.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.580
I poisoned everyone
at Shihou Stronghold.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.220
That was the first time

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.220
I used these hands

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.460
to kill.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.980
They deserved it.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.300
It wasn't your fault.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.580
The other sisters said the same.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.340
So, I blindly became the leader

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.060
and taking responsibility
for the entire stronghold.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.420
I wanted, through my effort,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.220
to let others live carefree

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.580
and unburdened.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.820
Three years had passed. I thought...

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.580
I was doing well enough.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.980
I could protect them.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.180
But they said...

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.300
You're already doing well.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.820
They wouldn't blame you.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.420
Crying too much won't be pretty.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.980
In the rumors,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.460
I was fierce and scary,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.180
over seven feet tall.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.060
Yet you

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.300
were the first to call me beautiful.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.340
Because you truly are.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.820
(Li Chengyu,
I find it hard to trust others.)

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.300
(But today,
I told you my true feelings.)

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.180
You won't do anything
to betray the stronghold,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.820
right?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.180
I can trust you,

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.580
right?

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.300
(Can someone like this really rebel?)

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.349
(With the evidence I provide,)

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.520
(the court soldiers will immediately
suppress the bandits.)

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.340
(Those following Chen Xinrou
in Qingfeng Stronghold aren't wrong.)

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.860
(Forced into rebellion,)

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.820
(they'll surely go to jail.)

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.989
Feel softhearted?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.300
Mm?

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.980
After being with them so long,
don't you have any feelings?

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.940
How could I not?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.060
These pieces of evidence
are capital crimes.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.100
How would I know?

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.820
But I don't want them to die.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.980
Could the evidence be faulty?

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.060
I'm just speculating.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.869
Have you noticed
anything unusual recently?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.180
You're asking me?

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.109
Checking evidence is your job.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.749
I just record daily events

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.340
and deliver messages to Minister Li.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.109
Alright.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.229
Then show me the notes
you've been keeping.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.420
Let me see them.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.309
Why should I show you?

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.989
Only Minister Li can see them.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.180
No.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.709
(General)

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.300
Is this enough?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.460
General.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.829
Yes, General.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:42.940
Stop.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.420
Don't give me that act.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.829
I don't care who you obeyed before,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.109
but now that I'm here,

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.629
you only follow me.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.540
