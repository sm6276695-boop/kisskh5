(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.370
Go change the water.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.259
Hurry up.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.490
Minmin.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.210
Stop fussing.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.170
I know my own body best,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.970
I won't live much longer.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.490
Don't talk nonsense.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.530
Don't cry.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.139
Little Sun.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.899
What little sun?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.850
Don't be anyone's Little Sun,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.490
I just want you to live well.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.330
You've given so much for the stronghold,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.770
I haven't even repaid you properly.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.690
I can't walk with you anymore

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.890
for the rest of the road.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.490
I'm leaving.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.690
Lianxin.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.610
Lianxin.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.890
You're joking with me, right?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.890
Lianxin.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.130
Lianxin.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.859
Heroine.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.690
What's your name?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.250
Tao Lianxin.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.050
From now on, we'll be good friends.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.979
Where's the boss?

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.810
I want to buy cloth.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490
We stopped selling cloth long ago.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.770
You're back.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.490
Who are you?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.330
Where are the people here?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.290
You can see them,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.050
but I need three things from you.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.259
First,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.010
The Sword of God of War on your back.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.570
You know this is the Sword of God of War,
and you still dare to ask for it?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.979
Second,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.730
the evidence you've gathered
of the rebels.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.090
Who exactly are you?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.050
You even know of the rebellion.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.370
Just tell me if you'll hand it over.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.730
Of course not.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.290
Third,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.090
your life.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.330
My life belongs to Heaven.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.890
If you want it, take it.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.490
What a joke.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.570
Don't forget everyone's life here
is in my hands.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.610
General Li.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.859
If I trade their lives for you
to leave now,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.539
would you do it?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.890
Of course not.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.010
Then you might want to reconsider.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.019
Father.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.099
Oh dear.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.490
Xinrou, why are you up?

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.210
Father?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.419
You're really the Chancellor.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.170
Absolutely.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.819
Weren't you said to be dead?

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.859
That's right.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.730
I am already dead,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.930
but it was an act staged
with His Majesty.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.219
The Emperor first received evidence

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.339
that clearly pointing out someone else
as the traitor.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.779
Within two days,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.019
Li Aotian's allies

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.010
submitted identical evidence,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.250
but claiming the Chancellor
was the traitor.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.490
The Emperor then knew
Li Aotian was disloyal,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.219
so he spread news of my hanging

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.339
to lure Li Aotian's men
to reveal themselves in the capital.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.050
They've all been arrested now.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.570
The Emperor has ordered
a thorough search.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.579
This sword

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.690
was found on the cliff.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.370
If one day we meet again,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.890
I will forge for the General

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.810
a weapon worthy of the God of War.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.050
It was her.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.010
This letter.

00:05:12.435 --> 00:05:13.760
(To Li Chengyu, personal)

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.899
(Young Master Li,)

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.579
(on the journey to the capital today,)

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.890
(I felt uneasy.)

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.770
(Fearing no return.)

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.690
(I prepared two identical
sets of evidence.)

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:33.330
(One copy has already been sent)

00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:34.932
(to the palace by another route)

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.690
(to ensure His Majesty receives it.)

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.930
(The other copy I carry with me.)

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.339
(If discovered
by ill-intentioned hands,)

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.330
(destroyed or forged,)

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.770
(it won't matter.)

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.130
(His Majesty will find the truth
with the evidence.)

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.450
(This sword I forged along the way.)

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.210
(I hope it befits you, Young Master.)

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.330
(Wishing you well.)

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.690
(If misfortune befalls me,)

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.690
(I will still not fail your trust.)

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.690
Then what you just did was...

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.699
That was the Emperor's test for you.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.250
A test?

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.979
The three questions earlier.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.339
First, asking for your
the Sword of God of War

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.930
that was to test your loyalty
to the Emperor.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.859
The second question,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.370
asking for your evidence

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.659
was to test whether you colluded
with the rebels.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.139
Had you truly given it,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.010
it would mean the Emperor misjudged you.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.659
The third question

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.130
to trade the lives
of the whole fortress for yours

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.930
was to test if your heart remained
as before.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.770
General Li,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.570
you truly are the right man
I chose for Xinrou.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.490
Tomorrow we set out to escort
Li Aotian back to the capital.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.770
If Xinrou

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.250
knew she'd end up
with General Li after all,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.930
why did she flee the marriage
in the first place?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.690
Why ask me to meet you here?

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.330
After all, we return
to the capital tomorrow.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.370
Some matters must be settled.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.330
Love began here,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.930
it should end here too.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.330
I really hate you men.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.050
Not a single merit from head to toe.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.050
You're no different.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.690
Do you know why I favor you alone?

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.570
Because fate decreed it.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.050
Heaven told me

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.250
my destined one is you.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.330
So the more I see you,
the more I like you.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.570
But you already belong to the boss.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.019
I, Qiu Ernian, act openly and upright.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.370
I would never steal another woman's man.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.930
By the way, let me warn you,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.459
treat the boss well.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.690
Otherwise, I'll chop you
into pieces and stew you.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.059
Alright.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.530
Since Second Boss has been so frank,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.979
I'll tell you a secret too.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.290
What is it?

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.690
That so-called
"best fortune slip" you drew

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.930
was also arranged by me in advance.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.530
Li Chengyu! I'll kill you!

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.410
She will always be here,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.690
always by your side.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.930
Little Stone.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.059
Little Stone.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.970
Your Majesty.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.290
You've finally returned.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.330
This time we truly owe it all to you.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.170
If not for you venturing
into the tiger's den for evidence,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.859
I would still be deceived by Li Aotian.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.299
By now, I'd be beyond redemption.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.690
Your Majesty flatters me.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.099
Even without me,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.090
you would've uncovered the truth.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.210
Now's not the time for modesty.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.850
This matter truly couldn't
be done without you.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.739
Really?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.170
Really.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.690
Feels pretty good to be a hero.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.330
Haven't you always been one?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.570
In the past, on the battlefield,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.690
you rendered great service for me.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.170
No.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.930
This is my first time being a hero.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.219
Tell me, why couldn't you give me
a hint beforehand?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.219
Xinrou and I nearly died at his hands.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.810
Are you even my brother?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.499
If I warned you ahead of time,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.459
wouldn't that have alerted him?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.570
Besides,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.170
don't you always say
Heaven protects the lucky?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.690
By the way,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.930
where is that evidence
you risked your life to guard?

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.530
Bring it out for me to see.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.499
How was this done?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.459
Your Majesty, we needed a master chef,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.699
one who could carve anything
as if it were food into any shape.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.579
And a makeup expert skilled in colors.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.339
We borrowed a rock's outer shell,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.579
split it in half,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.939
hollowed out the center bit by bit,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.579
then glued it back together.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.939
Look at this stone,

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.699
surely it must have seams.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.739
So I

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.819
colored the stone

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.979
to match its natural hue

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.970
and this is the result.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.930
Truly flawless.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.090
Put the evidence away.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.290
Guards!

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.690
Escort the three ladies to rest.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.930
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.859
Your Majesty.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.210
Enough.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.330
Now everything is settled.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.050
I shall hold a banquet
to grant you title and rank.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.379
You

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.379
will stay in the capital.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.930
Stay by my side.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.450
Continue as my General God of War.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.210
Your Majesty.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.970
I do not wish to remain in the capital.
