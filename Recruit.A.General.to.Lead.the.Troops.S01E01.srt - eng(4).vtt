=Recruit A General to Lead the Troops=

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.887
=Episode 1=

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.220
Li Chengyu.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.829
It's over for you.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.149
Surrender now.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.149
You moved most of the palace guards away
and struck while defenses were weak.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.860
That's treason.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.989
It's you who must surrender.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.980
Hmph.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.740
You still think
you're the invincible hero?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.109
Look.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.260
You're the only one left.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.460
You can't defend

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.980
the palace today.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.260
One man is enough.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.900
Your Majesty.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.909
Your Majesty.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.349
The corridor defense has fallen.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500
They're at the imperial study now.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.349
He can no longer use Thunderous Force.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.780
Why fear him?

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.549
He's poisoned.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.060
He lost his power.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.340
Attack!

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.069
Whoever takes Li Chengyu's head

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.989
will be rewarded 10,000 gold!

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.340
Kill!

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.780
(Ah, how comfortable.)

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.220
So this is the mighty God of War?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.220
Wow.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.900
I nearly drowned.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.460
Hey, where am I?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.660
Hey, why so much blood?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020
Let's see how many lives you have.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.180
What are you doing? You crazy?

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.340
Wasn't he poisoned?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.500
How can he still use that move?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.900
Another nightmare?

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.900
Ah!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.429
It hurts.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.620
Oh no.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.380
It's not a dream.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.580
Zhang!

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.269
Wasn't I bathing?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.780
Where am I?

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.900
This... this looks like

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.269
an ancient prison.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.670
(Prisoner)

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.940
Li Chengyu, time to die.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.789
No way.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.620
You want to kill me
right after I arrive?

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.580
Drink the medicine.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.580
Leave.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.820
(This is poison. They want to
poison me to death right after I arrive?)

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.060
Forget it if you won't drink.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.109
Last night, Vice Minister of War

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.820
suddenly raised troops to rebel.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.260
There must be a mole in the palace.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.580
After a secret search,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.060
these secret letters were found
in the rebel's room.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.260
All these letters

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.669
were sent to one place.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.580
Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.820
Qingfeng Stronghold?

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.909
Its leader, Chen Xinrou,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.220
is the daughter Chancellor
had with his mistress years ago.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.340
Few people know this.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.140
You suspect Chancellor?

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.260
I'm sending you
to infiltrate Qingfeng Stronghold

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.500
and find proof of his treason.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.940
Undercover?

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.820
(This stronghold is special.)

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.900
(It's formed by over 100 women.)

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.900
(No man are allowed to enter.)

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.580
How do I get in?

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.140
A spy in the stronghold revealed

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.580
they plan to abduct a man

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.620
as Chen Xinrou's husband.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.229
You will disguise as a farmer.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.780
I'll announce

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.669
that General God of War
rebelled and failed.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.109
He's been jailed

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.900
and is awaiting punishment.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.869
This stronghold

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.109
is full of monsters.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.900
They devour people.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.460
How frightening.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.020
Tao Lianxin,
fourth leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.469
Silent and reserved.
Skilled in martial arts.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.220
She's in charge
of the stronghold's defense.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.909
Anyone who flee

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.500
will be killed.

00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:46.029
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.029
You're always fighting.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.220
How annoying.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.549
The stronghold reeks of men.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.460
Do you men never bathe?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.029
Run?

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.020
Run again, and I'll break your legs.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.029
The meal's not ready.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.029
And the stronghold is in chaos.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.380
How sluggish.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.220
Qiu Erniang,
second leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.469
A fierce widow.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.669
Great cook.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.500
(Second leader, Qiu Erniang)
In charge of food.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.149
These are your names.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.789
I'll toss them in the air.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.029
Whoever falls into the vat,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.380
blame your bad luck.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.940
Choosing a husband like this
is careless.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.020
Why? We didn't run.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.909
Why my foot.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.020
Because all men deserve death!

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:41.182
(Li Qiang)

00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:45.645
(Li Chengyu)

00:08:52.207 --> 00:08:55.607
(Li Chengyu)

00:08:58.032 --> 00:09:00.344
(Preliminaries, First Round, Final)

00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:06.982
(Preliminaries:
Li Chengyu vs Wang Sanlang)

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.749
This round tests your strength.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.300
Two will fight on stage.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.869
(Win, Lose)
Winners stand here.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.709
Losers stand here.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.060
Do your best.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.700
Perform well, you may live.
(As in last round,)

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.660
(those unfit were dragged away.)

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.300
(Why keep the losers this time?)

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.420
(They already have
Tao Lianxin, who's skilled.)

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.820
(Why choose a live-in husband,)

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.940
(who's skilled in martial arts?)

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.629
(Or perhaps)

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:42.220
(they want a lucky fool.)

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.220
(So winning is losing,)

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.940
(losing is winning.)

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.882
(Lose)

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.660
Next round.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.949
Wen Minmin, youngest of all.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.709
Third leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.469
In charge of production.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.589
(They all want to live.)

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.220
(They'll fight to win.)

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.700
(Then losing will be easy for me.)

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.580
Hmph.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.100
I'll fight.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.229
Even if I die,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.349
I won't marry that demoness,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.940
Chen Xinrou.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.220
(Darn, he's not afraid to die.)

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.060
Come at me.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.220
(Hey.)

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.100
(This is way too fake.)

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.989
What should we do?

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.989
We can only choose two.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.740
If it's a tie,
we'll consider both as losers.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.180
Losers will enter next round.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.606
What?

00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:02.532
(Preliminaries, First round, Li Chengyu)

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.580
You've passed each round,
reaching the final.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.389
Listen.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.949
If you want to live,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.940
perform well.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.589
Qin Manyue,
fifth leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.589
Gentle and kind.
Skilled in calligraphy and arts.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.460
She's in charge of accounts.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.180
Only one will survive.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.989
Our leader's choice of husband

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.100
values equal status.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.349
Introduce your background first.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.469
(A live-in husband's status
doesn't matter.)

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.749
(The sadder I am,
the better chance to stay.)

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.629
(A pity contest?)

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.980
(I got it.)

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.060
(Lose)
Alright, I'll start.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.180
Hello, everyone.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.420
My name is Wang.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.820
I was born in a small mountain village.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.420
My kin and villagers live there.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.340
My family was very poor.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.469
My mother told me from young

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.660
that poor children grow up fast.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.589
All along,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.389
I really

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.980
don't know how I survived.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.229
Stop.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.740
It's too fake.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.629
Drag him away.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.349
No, my emotions

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.349
just came up.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.869
I haven't finished crying.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.180
Then continue.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.469
My parents

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.340
died before naming me.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.740
So I've always been Wang.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.109
Wang is fine.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.540
Better than being named Wang Fool.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.220
At 13,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.940
I didn't know my gender.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.100
Stop.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.829
It's too fake.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.709
Drag him away.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.349
Wait.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.349
I'm not done yet.
Don't rush. I have more.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.589
No, I still have something to say.
I'll do anything for you.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.940
I'll do it now.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.749
(They take lives lightly.)

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.420
(It's too much.)

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.229
You take lives lightly.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.580
It's too much.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.940
I also lost my parents young.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.389
I had no food to eat.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.949
I'm miserable enough.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.989
Yet I have to serve you
in this stronghold?

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.829
It's always women who serve men.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.389
When have men grovel like this?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.309
Well...

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.820
This is too humiliating.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.460
Emotionally unstable.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.349
Drag him away.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.229
Next.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.829
Hey, I'm emotionally stable.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.109
Hey, I'm not sick.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.189
I'm emotionally stable.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.220
(They said all my lines.)

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.940
(It's over. I'm doomed today.)

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.180
Don't speak.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.980
I feel your sincerity.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.589
Is this the chosen husband?

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.069
Erniang said today is a good day
to hold a wedding.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.420
We marry tonight.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.229
What's this?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.309
Chen Xinrou,
leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.349
No one knows her true appearance.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.309
Nor knows

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.860
how she became
Qingfeng Stronghold's leader.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.989
But rumors say
Chen Xinrou is seven feet tall.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.229
Strong and muscular.
Fierce-faced, sharp-toothed.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.309
She kills without blinking.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.820
Utterly terrifying.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.999
