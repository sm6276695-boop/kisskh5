00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.230
Chengyu,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.350
that's not how you play Go.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.510
If you want to play with me,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.710
you have to follow my rules.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.919
This is five in a row.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.390
I win.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.799
Fine,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.070
you win.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.270
I'm going to win, no matter what.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.879
You've been through so much danger

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.590
and yet you're still alive and here.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.550
That's really something.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.110
Just fortunate, that's all.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.670
Oh, right.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.270
The Chancellor has been arrested.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910
How do you feel about that?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.070
Aren't you worried about Chen Xinrou

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.790
if you take her back?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.510
I already told His Majesty
your thoughts.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.559
If he believed us, he'd wait longer

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.630
instead of arresting the Chancellor
as soon as the evidence came through.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.990
I told you,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.990
His Majesty just wants
to eliminate the Chancellor

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.550
once and for all.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.990
If you bring Xinrou back,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.510
she's as good as dead.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.150
Do you think Chen Xinrou is innocent?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.230
I have my ways to convince His Majesty
that she's not guilty.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.510
Very well.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.150
We'll go back together tomorrow.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.510
Report!

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.719
General.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.710
Sir.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.240
Chen Xinrou poisoned the prison guard.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.140
She threatened that the guard would die
if she doesn't get to see General Li.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.030
What?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.070
Do you still believe
Chen Xinrou is innocent?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.679
Ma'am, please, give me the antidote...

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.999
I don't want to die.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.679
I'm just a prison guard.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.279
Please...

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.110
Then why don't you hand over the keys?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.910
Let him go.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.630
I know you gave him a tonic.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.510
A tonic?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.350
You scoundrel!

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.190
You wanted to see me.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.350
I'm here now.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.510
Say whatever

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.599
you want,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.670
curse me all you like.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.039
Shouldn't you say something to me?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.190
- You're the one who wanted to see me.
- Yes, but...

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.910
I'm waiting

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.510
for your explanation.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.590
I...

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.510
Fine.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.470
You won't say it?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.350
Fine, I'll say it then.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.710
Li Chengyu.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.950
Do you know
what it feels like to be betrayed

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.070
by someone you care about?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.270
You're a general?

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.279
Yes.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.510
You came to Qingfeng Stronghold looking

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.910
for proof of treason?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.119
Yes.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.150
You're investigating me.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.590
Yes.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.150
Once you get the evidence,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.950
you're going
to destroy Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.999
Isn't that right?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.830
Yes!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.559
But...

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.350
I don't want to hear your excuses!

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.710
Everything happening now

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.230
is exactly how you planned it.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.679
You pretended to be a farmer,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.390
married into my family,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.950
and earned the trust of me
and the other leaders.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.439
Then, in our darkest hour,
you make your move

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.710
so we're grateful to you.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.470
Everything you've done
was part of your plan.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.799
Were Liu Pitang
and that corrupt official

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.950
your accomplices too?

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.150
Don't touch me!

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.919
It's not what you think.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.470
Then what is the truth?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.910
I never truly understood you,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.950
and you never saw me
as one of your own.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.150
If you weren't plotting against me,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.470
what reason would you have

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.150
to keep me,
the person involved, in the dark?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.350
If you want to find evidence,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.470
why don't you ask me?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.950
Why not ask what I think,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.799
whether I'm involved?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.950
- Because I didn't want you dragged into this!
- But I already am!

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.950
Qingfeng Stronghold, my friends,
we're all tangled up in this now.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.239
And now I'm locked up in this dungeon

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.150
all because of you!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.950
Xinrou,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.599
I can explain...

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.070
Don't touch me!

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.830
Xinrou...

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.830
Get out of my sight!

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.070
General, what's going on?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.030
Nothing. Leave us.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.710
Yes, sir.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.590
Xinrou, take care of yourself

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.150
while you're here.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.510
If danger comes,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.790
you have to fight back
just like you're doing now.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.470
Stab hard with the hairpin,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.150
all right?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.990
Still no sign of Qin Manyue?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.119
We didn't ask you to come here to drink!

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.079
How much more are you hiding from us?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.590
And is that imperial decree real?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.199
If you don't come clean today,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.550
you're not leaving.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.950
Chengyu, we genuinely consider you
part of our family.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.590
Xinrou too.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.239
Even if you stayed silent

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.950
to protect us,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.519
how do you know

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.239
we're not willing

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.590
to share the burden with you and Xinrou?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.719
(The Chancellor has committed suicide
in the capital.)

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.950
(The Chancellor has committed suicide
in the capital.)

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.350
(The Chancellor is dead.)

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.110
(Chen Xinrou is of no use anymore.)

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.750
(In that case...)

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.590
Xinrou.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.599
Manyue, what brings you here?

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.110
Where are the others?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.710
Li Chengyu let them in last time.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.950
I asked Minister Li to let me in.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.470
Minister Li?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.590
Li Chengyu's older brother,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.070
Li Aotian?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.070
So he's the one

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.550
you can't stop thinking about.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.710
I'm sorry.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.350
Minister Li sent me,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.750
but I've never done anything
to betray the stronghold.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.350
I only kept daily records.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.470
I haven't told them anything important.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.310
So it was your secret messages
that allowed Li Chengyu

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.870
to disguise himself as a farmer
and enter the stronghold.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.310
Thank you for clearing up
many of my doubts.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.750
After all these years as friends,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.950
I'm glad you trusted me enough

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.870
to be honest.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.590
Erniang made this for you.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.110
Try it.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.750
All right.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.550
It's good.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.199
You should've

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.639
told us sooner!

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.550
Even if you only told the three of us,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.590
we could have helped find the evidence.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.350
All men are the same!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.710
So stubborn and prideful!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.710
Even if I'd told you earlier,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.879
you might not have believed me.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.879
Chengyu,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.999
do you know who the real mastermind is?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.999
Could it be someone

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.470
who's been by your side all along?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.230
Aotian!

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.310
I always hold you back.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.959
I'm sorry.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.990
If he really wanted
to get rid of the Chancellor

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.110
and stage a rebellion,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.070
he would have gone back
to the capital already.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.990
He wouldn't still be here with me.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.190
Because he can't kill you,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.110
he's trying to stop you from returning.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.350
He seemed uneasy about me
returning to the capital with Xinrou.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.950
His arrival did delay me

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.950
getting Xinrou back to the capital.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.710
It sounds like

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.190
he's trying to keep you from going back.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.310
But you're so capable.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.350
If you want to bring Xinrou back,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.870
what can he do to stop you?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.750
