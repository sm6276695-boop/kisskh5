00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.550
You went to catch him cheating
and left me out.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.990
I was afraid you'd kill him on the spot.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.070
It's not too late to kill him now.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.070
Chengyu, you've gone
way too far this time.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.190
Xinrou, if you can detoxify her,
please help me save her.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.830
Miss Dongfang is awake.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.830
Thank you, for saving me.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.550
Don't thank me yet.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.510
Just tell me who sent you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.919
I can't tell you yet.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.310
Once the poison is gone,
I'll tell you everything.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.230
So, you don't trust me.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.510
Up, up, up!

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.230
Move aside!

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.519
Liu Pitang, you actually
dared to show your face!

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910
You've got a heart of stone.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.359
After all the time we spent together,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.159
you sent people to kill me.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.910
Cold Tiger!

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.439
Isn't this Mr. Liu the shopkeeper?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.630
Did you forget?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.079
Mr. Liu?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.919
Funny.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.150
Hahaha.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.790
Shopkeeper Liu,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.790
what brings you here today?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.350
Master Li.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.359
I didn't come here for pleasure.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.630
I came to demand justice.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.799
That Miss Dongfang you took away

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.439
was in love with me.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.230
We were already getting married.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.879
Why did you steal the woman I love?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.990
Why you...

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.710
Wasn't Liu Pitang captured?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.079
Why is he still alive?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.159
I'll kill him myself.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.310
Wait!

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.159
Mr. Liu, mind your words.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.319
We have a crowd here.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.910
Everyone is watching.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.070
I don't know any Mr. Liu.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.590
And I'm not betrothed to him.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.510
The one I'm truly in love
with is Young Master Li.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.719
You heard her yourself.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.190
She made it very clear.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.839
You'd best leave.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.070
Don't stick around here.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.910
My dear Shan...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.190
I know I haven't treated you well.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.910
I beg your forgiveness.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.159
I deserve the worst.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.839
I deserve it!

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.110
I deserve it!

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.159
But it was only one quarrel.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.190
Why would you pretend not to know me?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.910
Wait...

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.590
We even have a marriage contract!

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.510
It's written here in black and white!

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.319
Take a look for yourselves.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.910
Be my witnesses.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.559
It's written here, clear as day!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.670
Nonsense!

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.750
Master Li.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.750
My feelings for Shan are true.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.159
I miss her day and night.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.159
My yearning sickens me.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.439
I beg you.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.719
Give her back to me.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.239
I'll kneel and kowtow to you.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.950
I'll kowtow!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.879
Master Li, I'm begging you.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.510
I'll kowtow to you.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.599
I beg you.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.110
I'll kowtow to you!

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.399
Liu Pitang,
with acting skills like that,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.910
why aren't you on the stage?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.390
On the what?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.910
I don't even understand
what you're saying.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.910
Master Li.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.070
Fine.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.390
If you insist...

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.159
If you insist

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.719
that Miss Dongfang belongs to you,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.070
then show us some proof,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.150
right here before everyone.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.910
We need some convincing!

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.119
Right?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.390
Isn't that so?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.710
Li Chengyu.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.350
Here's the antidote.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.119
Give it to Miss Dongfang.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.070
He's trying to take her away.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.390
You two...

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.830
You should get married now.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.679
Xinrou!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.719
No more nonsense.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.799
Do you really want to
watch him take her away?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.950
Hurry!

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.790
Of course they can prove it.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.799
If you don't step in,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.039
they'll be married on the spot.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.350
Mr. Liu, since you're already here,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.390
why not bear witness with all of us?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.239
Let them bow to heaven
and earth right here and wed.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.950
This won't do!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.830
This won't do! No!

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.270
Absolutely not!

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.830
No, no!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.710
Hurry up.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.830
Fine.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.910
Everyone here, bear witness.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.470
I, Li Chengyu,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.350
will wed Miss Dongfang here and now.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.470
First bow to heaven and earth.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.070
Second bow to the parents.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.470
Bow to each other.

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.055
(A House of Joy)

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.230
The ceremony is complete.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.830
Good.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.030
Good.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.390
Mr. Liu, still not leaving?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.950
Are you planning to steal
another man's wife in broad daylight?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.430
Go!

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.950
Shihou Stronghold isn't safe.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.590
Head to Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.239
What are you doing?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.879
We're officially married.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.230
We are husband and wife.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.470
It's a wife's duty to serve her husband.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.919
I told you. It was just an act.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.390
Why take it so seriously?

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.790
Put this on.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.950
Qingfeng Stronghold is full of traps.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.590
Liu Pitang won't get in.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.350
You seem to be recovering well.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.390
I've purged the poison for you.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.350
Don't you think
you owe me some answers?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.470
Are you sure

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.919
you want to know who it was?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.070
Tell me.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.390
I don't know who's behind it.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.879
I only know the one
who hired me to forge the weapons.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.350
His name was Li Fang.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.590
He wore a mask,
so I couldn't see his face.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.390
But judging by his clothes,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.710
he must've been working
for a high official in the capital.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.590
Li Fang...

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.999
(I don't know the court well enough.)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.710
(How would I know who Li Fang is?)

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.590
I still have the receipt
from when he paid me.

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:56.439
(Three thousand taels
paid to Dongfang Shan, by Li Fang)

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.350
(It matches the handwriting found
in the Vice Minister of War's letters.)

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.070
(Dongfang Shan didn't lie to me.)

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.950
In any case,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.230
thank you, Young Master,
for saving my life today.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.230
I hate owing favors.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.390
I have nothing to give you in return.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.950
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.510
Hey!

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.599
What's the deal with Li Chengyu?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.039
He didn't come to cheer you up.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.599
And he claims he has
private business with Dongfang Shan?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.470
Hmph.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.239
Xinrou.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.519
What happened to you just now?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.470
Why did you officiate
their wedding ceremony?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.119
Because too many
past misunderstandings

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.870
have sown rifts between us sisters.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.310
Distrust breeds gossip,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.950
gossip breeds discord,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.550
and business comes to a halt.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.959
This time, I want to try believing him.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.470
He is all alone with a woman.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.470
You may trust him, but I don't.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.639
I think the Leader is right.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.470
We're one family,
we have to trust each other.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.599
He may be alone with the woman,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.910
but she could just be decent company.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.839
Talking is a waste of time.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.950
If you don't believe it,
see for yourselves.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.710
Let this kiss be my thanks,
Young Master.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.710
Shameless.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.710
The drug didn't work?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.710
How did you know
I was trying to kill you?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.119
From the way you and Liu Pitang
acted just now,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.310
I knew something was off.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.590
If he truly wanted to take you away,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.750
he wouldn't have left so easily.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.190
I never meant to kill you.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.830
But I had no choice.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.470
The weapons I forged
were used for treason.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.950
If my involvement is known,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.710
my family will be doomed.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.950
I can only keep
walking down this path of no return.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.350
Even if...

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.950
you are a good man.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.119
I gave you the antidote and cured you.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.110
That proves I can protect you.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.750
I don't trust anyone.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.990
Believe it or not,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.950
only I can keep you safe.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.750
Protect me? How exactly?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.870
Enough talk.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.550
Just wait and see.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.350
Li Chengyu, are you into
some kind of perverted tricks?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.470
It's getting impossible
to explain myself.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.479
Manyue, after all this,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.350
are you still going to defend him?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.350
Even the study hall has been defiled.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.359
No, I can't stand this anymore!

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.230
Everyone, out.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.959
Leader, look at him!

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.110
Out!

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.710
Let's go.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.310
Don't hold me back!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.350
Li Chengyu.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.999
They've all left now.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.590
It's just us two.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.479
Hear me out.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.430
No. Let me explain.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.110
She just tried to kill me.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.399
Didn't you bring her back yourself?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.950
Why would she want you dead?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.430
Young Master, even if you can't have me,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.359
must you slander me so?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.990
But you...

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.070
Ah, here you are!

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.639
I need a word with you.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.110
Come with me.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.590
You need something?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.950
Come on, let's go.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.999
No, wait.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.110
Come, this way.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.359
This way.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.359
Listen to me.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.719
You can't leave those two alone.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.959
There will be trouble!

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.999
Brother, let the women

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.239
settle their scores.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.719
We'll just wait outside.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.230
If they start fighting,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.310
we'll step in and break it up, eh?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.950
Why are you staring at me?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.470
I've met many people in this world.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.070
But never someone like you.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.959
To save me,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.599
you let the one you love most

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.950
marry another before everyone's eyes.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.710
And you risked everything to cure me.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.310
Tell me.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.710
Is it me you love, or him?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.070
That's my business.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.990
None of your concern.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.310
I didn't save you
out of my feelings for him.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.110
Then why?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.310
To me,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.110
you're just a patient.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.959
Does a doctor
need a reason to save someone?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.870
You're lucky to have
such a clever pal like me.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.710
I could see the Boss
was about to blow her top.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.119
If you'd stayed,
you'd have lost that argument.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.470
That'd have been awkward.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.310
But honestly, I envy you.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.710
Think about it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.710
The Boss is devoted to you.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.239
The Second Boss thinks you're fated.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.599
The Third Boss respects you deeply.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.599
The Fourth Boss has already
pledged her heart to you.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.119
The Fifth Boss obeys your every word.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.079
And now there's even
this undefeated Dongfang girl.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.470
