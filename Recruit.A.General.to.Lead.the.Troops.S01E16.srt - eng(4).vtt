00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.390
Chengyu!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.750
Chengyu! Chengyu!

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.830
Chengyu!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.550
Who did this?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.270
Who did this?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.270
Help!

00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:00.830
Help!

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799
Chengyu...

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.879
You must live,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.990
Chengyu.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.350
I lost my parents at young age.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.350
I have no one to rely on.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.350
I was fortunate enough to have met you.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.999
If you died,
I'd have no one to rely upon,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.150
Chengyu!

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.799
Don't die,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.910
Chengyu!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070
Help!

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.270
Help!

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.990
Help!

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.719
Chengyu!

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510
You're making too much noise!

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.990
Chengyu.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.990
You're still alive, Chengyu.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.270
The arrow is poisoned.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.150
Poisoned?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.150
Luckily, I've had those pills
given by Chen Xinrou.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.990
Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.790
What are you talking about?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.910
Cold Tiger.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.430
What we can do now is keep moving.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.230
Let's see if we can find the exit.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.510
You took the arrow for me.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.110
How do I even repay your kindness?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.390
Repay, your foot.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.439
There's nothing for you to repay.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.230
Nothing to repay?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.030
What do you mean?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.750
Liu Pitang and I made these weapons.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.310
That's a lot.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.350
Slowly, we need to find

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.910
the way out.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.230
Have a seat here. That's a chair.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.950
That's scary.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.920
Eh? Wait.

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:11.559
Eh? Wait.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.750
Chengyu.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.310
There are some words here.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.510
What's that?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.350
Read them out.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.060
I, what Fang...

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.070
I, what Fang...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.750
Fang?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.390
Li Fang?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.070
"I, Li Fang, came here under the order
of the Vice Minister of War

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:42.043
to find Dongfang Shan
to forge unique weapons.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.670
I hid myself in Shihou Stronghold,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.510
secretly making weapons.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.950
But when I heard
the imperial court's siege had failed,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.350
I feared being exposed.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.910
So I moved out overnight.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.707
And on the night
of the husband-choosing festival

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:03.310
at Qingfeng Stronghold, I disguised myself
as a villager from the Li Family Village

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.392
and slipped the letters exchanged
with the Ministry of War

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:08.070
into the Treasure Pavilion,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.790
framing Chen Xinrou for it.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.350
Then I came back here
to clean up the mess.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.750
But unexpectedly..."

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.479
Where's the rest?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.590
He didn't finish writing it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.390
I guess he didn't made it.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.879
Yes. That must be it.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.799
Like you, he didn't made it.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.590
Wait. Chengyu!

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.030
Chengyu!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.439
Don't die!

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.270
Hang in there, Chengyu!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.830
I still need you!

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.790
You're my family!

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.350
I can't live without you!

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.710
(I haven't seen Li Chengyu in a day.)

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.710
(Why has he been avoiding me lately?)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.070
Magistrate.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.350
This is it!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.719
Li Chengyu is poisoned,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.150
so he can no longer run away.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.359
Search inside!

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.390
Hold on.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.479
If we unseal the cave,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.950
he'd be able to get away with it.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.599
Get some explosives

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.390
and blow this cave apart.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.950
Blow it apart?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.350
I should've thought of that.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.479
How wise of you.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.279
That's brilliant.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.710
How brilliant.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.359
Mysterious Sir never let us down.
Go get us some explosives here!

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.590
- Hurry!
- Quick!

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.230
Leader.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.790
Are you worried about Mr. Li?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.710
I was trying to verify the ledger
with him last night, but he wasn't around.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.710
Besides, Cold Tiger
was nowhere to be seen too.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.270
Someone

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.790
help us!

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.390
Chengyu is dying! Help!

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.470
Chengyu is dying!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.390
He's dying...

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.359
What happened?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.710
Chengyu has had a poisoned arrow.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.270
A poisoned arrow?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.590
Chengyu? Chengyu?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.910
Chengyu!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.350
Quick. It's lethal.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.390
Chengyu.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.070
(Am I leaving soon?)

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.710
(I'm just a nobody.)

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.950
(Everyone's life is different.)

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.950
(But...)

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.790
(But I want to be a hero too.)

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.270
(It feels nice to be one.)

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.230
(I want to protect these people.)

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.799
(I want to find out the truth)

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.470
(and prove to Heaven)

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.950
(that a nobody can be a hero as well.)

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.710
Sir.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.710
Now that Li Chengyu is dead,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.470
we're completely free from worries.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.910
No.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.390
Dongfang Shan is still alive.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.390
I

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.679
will get rid of her.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.830
Go ahead.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.750
Come with me!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.999
What is this, Liu Pitang?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.599
Well,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.350
I'm here to seal off Qingfeng Stronghold
on the county magistrate's command.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.110
What are we guilty of?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.359
(Wanted)
What are you guilty of?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.759
Dongfang Shan was involved
in making weapons for the rebellion.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.710
And I'm going to arrest her.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.399
Go ahead and search the place!

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.550
Stop!

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.519
Listen up, Chen Xinrou.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.079
Harboring a wanted criminal

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.639
is a capital offense.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.639
Whoever you're looking for,
he's not here.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.350
Instead of causing a scene here,
you might as well search elsewhere.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.230
Also, as far as I know,
you're a mere shopkeeper.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.070
Catching criminals
is the officials' job.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.990
So, what gives you the right
to be barging into here?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.350
How sharp-tongue you are!

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.950
I'm telling you.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.590
Today, I'm going
to get rid of you all too.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.719
You were safe because of Li Chengyu.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.710
If not, you'd have been
dealt with long ago.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.759
He's gone now.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.599
Let's see who's going to protect you.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.759
Charge!

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.950
Stop it!

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.190
Who said I'm dead?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.239
Don't die!

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.230
Hang in there, Chengyu!

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.590
I still need you!

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.110
You're my family!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.750
I can't live without you!

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.430
My parents died when I was young.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.190
I've been all alone.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.350
What are you doing?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.950
Go find the exit.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.710
Chengyu.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.839
There are wind

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.110
and a crack.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.759
Is that Li Chengyu?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.119
Oh my goodness!

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.479
He's still alive! Run!

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.959
Run! Open the door!

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.350
Good grief! Quick!

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.350
Li Chengyu!

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.830
(I can't stay here any longer.)

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.710
They're trying to catch me.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.950
And they won't stop until they find me.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.110
Are you leaving?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.070
Qingfeng Stronghold has been
put on the spot because of me.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.070
I'm going north.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.590
It's where my home is.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.750
If so, could you do me a favor?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.750
What's it?

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.350
There are three papers

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.590
and two arrows inside.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.990
The first sheet of paper

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.750
is a letter between Li Fang
and the rebels.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.350
The second sheet

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.710
is the statement Li Fang made
when he asked you to forge weapons.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.759
The third one is an inscription he left
before he died.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.310
I made a rubbing of it
from the big rock.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.470
As for these two arrows,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.230
one was made by the rebels,

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.950
the other by you.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.103
Take all this evidence with you
to the capital

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:36.470
and present it to His Majesty.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.750
I believe His Majesty will protect you.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.470
But how do I see His Majesty?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.590
Cold Tiger.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.999
Cold Tiger!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.590
Chengyu!

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.950
Chengyu!

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.310
What's the matter, Chengyu?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.590
Are you having
a surge of vitality before death?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.129
Stop cursing me already.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.079
Give me the token.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.350
Oh, the gold medal.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.879
Are you leaving?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.190
Farewell.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.710
Take this token and depart for it.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.870
Have a safe journey.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.950
If you ever ran into danger,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.710
forget about evidence,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.430
you must save yourself.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.359
If we ever see each other again,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.110
I will

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.710
make you a God of War weapon.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.719
See you again,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.070
Li Chengyu.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.359
(I hope)

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.950
(I can clear
Qingfeng Stronghold's name.)
