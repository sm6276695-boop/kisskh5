=Episode 4=

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.670
Those shopkeepers have actually
joined hands with Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.070
Now that they've joined forces,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.870
no one supplies us anymore.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.550
They've cut off the source of income
for our Shihou Stronghold.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.479
Hahaha...

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.559
Brother.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.630
Brother.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.199
You're the boss or I'm the boss?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.190
You're the boss.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.350
Brother, sit.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.879
Weren't we just putting on an act
in front of those shopkeepers?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.470
Were you too carried away?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.110
You rascal.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.110
Let me tell you.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.519
Those shopkeepers teamed up
with Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.719
They've made money.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.070
Those old fools
dare to make a fool out of me.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.150
Brother, what should we do?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.630
Chen Xinrou.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.990
If it weren't for her,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.799
my stronghold wouldn't have fallen.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.199
My brothers wouldn't be dead.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.079
That's right.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.430
Eighty-one men.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.359
A full eighty-one men!

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.719
Eighty-one men!

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.159
Only the two of us survived.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.630
Brother...

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.150
You've stirred up my grief again.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.350
Brother, I've found out.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.159
The culprit
is the new husband Chen Xinrou

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.439
just brought home, named Li Chengyu.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.870
Li Chengyu?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.270
He helped Qingfeng Stronghold
out of crisis.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.359
He is indeed talented.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.510
Hmm.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.439
Tell Yun to bring him here,
I want to see him.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.990
All right, I'll go at once.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.630
What is this?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.919
Who are you?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.439
We have no grudge, no feud.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.710
What are you doing?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.630
How do I reach that secret agent?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.630
He has a unique peacock mark
on his body.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.230
You can find him through that mark.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.510
I'm also one of His Majesty's men.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.830
You're a secret agent too?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.510
Wait, you... you're Yun.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.959
Every agent bears a mark.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.999
Show me your mark.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.599
Hey, hey!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.719
I'm new here.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.230
I haven't had it done yet.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.319
I am a general.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.750
Why waste words with you?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.879
(General)
I am the General God of War.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.470
Is that enough?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.070
The General God of War?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.510
You are the General?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.670
General...

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.750
You seem so excited to meet the General.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.719
General...

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.670
Please, save my family.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.630
Shihou Stronghold has taken them.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.350
They forced me to set the fire.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.479
And now,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.159
they want me to bind you
and take you there too.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.479
General, I had no choice.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.070
I beg you to act.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.119
If you are willing to rescue my family,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.910
I will tell you everything
I have found out.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.910
What do you know?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.750
I know where they hid the key evidence.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.879
All right, but your clothes
stand out too much.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.590
Change, and let's go.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.790
Yun!

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.630
Yun!

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.510
Li Chengyu, what on earth are you doing?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.439
Why are you here?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.719
If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have known
what you were up to.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.999
And I trusted you so much.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.150
Well.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.830
Another woman shows up?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.479
Li Chengyu, our leader said this,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.679
you've got talent.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.479
Why not join our Shihou Stronghold?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.599
But only you are invited.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.919
The rest, kill them.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.070
All right.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.030
I'll go with you.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.270
You'll go with them?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.830
They're from Shihou Stronghold.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.470
Ah!

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.590
Overestimating yourself.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.270
Yun.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.470
This...

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.590
Why does she cough blood
every time she uses that move?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.390
(Qingfeng Stronghold)
I know you didn't kill Yun.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.390
And I never poisoned you.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.830
It wasn't you who poisoned me?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.150
Then what was it you fed me?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.350
A tonic.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.710
A tonic for what?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.599
I don't know what it's for.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.150
See for yourself.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.150
You're using me as a test subject?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.150
Go after whoever poisoned you.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.590
You may leave the mountain now.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.799
(Leaving the mountain?)

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.030
(I just learnt the evidence
is in the Treasure Pavilion.)

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.039
(I can't leave.)

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.390
You're asking me to leave?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.030
You still don't trust me.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.879
What can I trust you with?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.799
Mr. Qian treated you
as an honored guest.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.359
Yun trusted you, not me.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.359
You knocked me out
in front of Shihou Stronghold,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.950
and yet we still made it back alive.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.390
Li Chengyu,
give me one reason to trust you.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.679
Chen Xinrou.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.766
What if I like you?

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:27.359
♪Being unnoticed,
yet I still tell you I love you♪

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.470

♪But my confession
is drowned out by the wind♪

Since things have come to this,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.566
I won't hide it anymore.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.710
Chen Xinrou,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.999
I like you.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.879
From the first moment I saw you,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.359
I realised
you were nothing like the rumors.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.239
You are different.

00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:48.039
Gentle and gracious.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.991
Not even rumors could sway you.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.359
When everyone else doubted me,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.229
only you...

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.516
Only you gave me this chance.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.790
I truly don't want to leave.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.359
But if you insist on sending me away,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.359
♪You brushed past me,

♪Yet I seem to clutch you,
unable to let you fade into the crowd♪

Ah?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.999
Fine, I'll leave.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.390
Who would want to stay
in this wretched place anyway?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.599
Did my act just now seem unconvincing?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.830
I thought I played it quite well.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.070
Yet she still saw through it.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.150
I feel like
I'm getting used to this body.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.950
Ordinary moves aren't a problem anymore.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.830
But whenever I use
that charged technique, I cough blood.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.350
No, I'll try again.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.390
Ah...

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.910
Still the same.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.719
Erniang.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.359
Hm?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.470
What sort of person
do you think Li Chengyu is?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.070
Rubbish.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.239
We chose him
to bring fortune to the stronghold.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.710
But ever since he arrived,
nothing good has happened.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.710
And every misfortune is tied to him.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.719
Leader, you were right
to drive him away.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.710
Keeping him here
would only bring us harm.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.870
As expected, no man is any good.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.470
Brothers!

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.999
Our big brother has spoken.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.959
We'll guard here at Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.350
on the only way down the mountain.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.639
If anyone comes alone,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.950
we strike!

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.950
That's right.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.710
Ha!

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.310
Isn't that Li Chengyu?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.239
Brothers!

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.950
After him!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.590
Stop!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.430
Hm?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.830
Take him.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.550
What's wrong?

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.199
I've been poisoned
by Soft Muscle Powder.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.230
It's too cold.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.599
What are you doing?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.719
Keeping warm.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.830
Get off.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.830
Alright.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.599
Hey...

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.750
Move closer this way.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.079
I didn't mean anything.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.710
I just don't want you
freezing to death here.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.079
Hey, don't fall asleep.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.110
If you sleep now, you'll never wake.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.950
Be quiet.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.950
Don't sleep.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.590
Let's talk instead.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.479
I've nothing else to do anyway.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.479
Come on, tell me.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.759
Your Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.350
why do you have such a deep feud
with Shihou Stronghold?

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.879
Why should I tell you?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.190
Hey.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.599
If we really die here,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.119
I reckon,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.599
I'll end up back delivering takeaways.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.479
By then,
even if you want to tell someone,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.870
no one will hear.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.870
Brother, those two
are locked in the dungeon.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.470
Catch.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.870
Both of them were caught by you.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.190
I truly favor you.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.870
Give me a reward then.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.670
Applaud.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.310
Brother, what do we do with them?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.750
The woman,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.470
dispose of her.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.719
As for that pretty boy,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.599
if he submits, let him go.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.359
If he refuses, dispose of him too.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.470
Alright.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.670
Bring the axe.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.350
Hm.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.190
Hey.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.359
I'm just saying,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.590
has our stronghold grown this poor?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.830
Where's the meat?

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.590
You eat it?

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.239
I didn't.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.830
(Qingfeng Stronghold
used to be Liu Pitang's turf.)

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.350
(They plundered and pillaged,
committing every crime.)

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.950
(The leader and I were captured
and taken there too.)

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.230
(Later...)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.999
(Later, the leader)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.959
(couldn't bear to see the women
in the stronghold abused.)

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.710
(We seized the chance
and slaughtered them all in secret.)

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.310
(Only Liu Pitang
and Cold Tiger escaped by luck.)

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.310
(Afterwards, they
founded Shihou Stronghold.)

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.719
So aren't you afraid they'll return

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.119
and seize your land again?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.350
They wouldn't dare.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.999
Inside and outside the stronghold,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.950
we've set countless traps.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.470
(Every ten feet beyond the gate,)

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.239
(there's a hidden pitfall.)

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.079
(If they dare to storm in,)

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.590
(they'll never return alive.)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.550
Do you want to live?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.590
Why do you ask?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.639
My hairpin is sharp.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.190
It's my lifeline.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.590
Take it off.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.999
See if it can cut the ropes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.879
You had this thing,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.310
