=Episode 10=

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.509
You still don't understand,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.869
as long as it's the Chancellor,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.020
the truth doesn't matter.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.909
The Emperor used to give orders,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.149
you never hesitated,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.900
but this time...

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.980
You're not really falling
for Chen Xinrou, are you?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.220
Impossible.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.220
She has a fierce face.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.620
I'm not blind.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.420
Then take people
to capture her immediately.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.620
No!

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.860
Okay.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.900
Even if I really have feelings for her,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.820
can you give me some time?

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.340
I'm begging you.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.060
Okay.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.420
We are brothers.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.260
There must be no rift.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.700
Then...

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.620
I'll go delay the Emperor a bit more.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.789
Ah.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.789
That's my good big brother.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.869
By the way,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.060
I have one more favor to ask.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.420
Speak.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.780
Whether that man we caught today

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.860
is guilty or not,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.900
help me kill him.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.349
He didn't do anything to you, right?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.340
I won't let him get away.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.620
He can't do anything to me.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.260
I understand.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.220
You want to stand up for Chen Xinrou.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.420
Let's go, I'll escort you back.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.060
Don't worry, I'll still be
in the role of the steward.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.149
I just want to see

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.220
what kind of girl
could make you fall for her.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.709
Go.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.620
Please.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.269
Aotian.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.429
Why do you insist on

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.669
going up the mountain?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.109
Look at your cough.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.429
I want to see if you're doing well.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.220
I worry about you.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.780
By the way, they're...

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.269
They're not targeting you,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.220
they're targeting every man.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.900
No men are allowed in this stronghold.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.460
Who is he?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.500
You misunderstood.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.869
This is Mr. Qian,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.740
newly hired steward at the winery.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.709
We helped each other
take down Shihou Stronghold.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.109
Mr. Qian also shone.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.620
They're here to give gifts.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.669
From the head steward
to the servants, all are like this.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.269
No rules.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.020
Just walked straight in.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.620
He has no manners,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.900
don't you understand, Yulang?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.869
Yulang?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.900
It's my first time
hearing this title too.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.829
Enough.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.500
The gift has been delivered. Go away.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.269
(I know your whole family was wronged.)

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.220
(I can save you,)

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.220
(but you must do something for me.)

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.780
Your Majesty.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.109
How is the situation over there?

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.380
Allow me to report in detail.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.029
This mission relied on Chengyu
leading troops up the mountain,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.669
many bandits captured.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.669
The leader seems related to treason,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.700
already imprisoned in the capital,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.260
but Chengyu thinks
Qingfeng Stronghold has other secrets.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.269
The evidence seems questionable too.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.340
He doesn't want to alert them,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.500
and plans to stay in Qingfeng Stronghold
to investigate further.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.789
Requesting more time from Your Majesty.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.900
Chengyu will see this matter
through to the end.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500
Not completely without results, right?

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.340
Minister Li.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.820
Since you are already involved in this,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.340
I will leave this case in your hands.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.909
Work with Chengyu,
coordinate inside and outside,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.460
annihilate the rebels in one move.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.260
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.700
Lianxin.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.820
What are you doing? Having a meeting?

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.029
Can't you see?

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.589
Four of them fighting for territory.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.140
Fighting for territory?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.140
I plan to take this hill
of Shihou Stronghold,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.460
so I let them four figure out
what they can do here.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.989
After one night, hmph.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.469
Look how spacious it is.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.109
Of course, it's for me to cook.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.820
Or to dry flower petals.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.989
A training ground.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.589
Let's open a school.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.580
I think learning is more important.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.349
If you ask me,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.669
these four leaders

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.060
are quite busy.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.580
Why not let me renovate this place?

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.149
I have an idea.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.319
I want to open a holiday resort.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.229
(Yuchang Hot Springs)

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.269
(Qingfeng Stronghold
has a women's hot spring.)

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.820
(Shihou Stronghold should have
a men's hot spring too.)

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.549
(Considering parents bringing kids,)

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.720
(Advertisement promotion)
(and kids have endless energy.)

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.589
(If kids are happy,
parents will naturally bring them.)

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.109
(Dad's dad is grandpa.)

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.669
(Mom's mom is grandma.)

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.260
(Ring toss,)

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.460
(claw machine,)

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.260
(and other small games,)

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.789
(plus some more)

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.020
(Shihou Stronghold's
natural advantages.)

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.669
You rascal, let me chop you to death!

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.789
Hey, Second Lady!

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.140
Don't hit people!

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.820
Everything needed is here,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.380
but something feels missing.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.380
Got it,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.700
How could we miss

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.580
"House of Joy"?

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:36.207
(House of Joy)

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.349
Come, let's drink.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.420
Thirsty?

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.069
Didn't expect our "House of Joy"

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.460
to be this fun.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.660
Here, I toast you.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.660
Drinking straight is boring, let's play.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.869
You can play dice too?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.820
Here.

00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:25.945
(Drink no riding, ride no drinking)

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.660
Hmm.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.860
Haha.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.700
Li Chengyu.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.300
I want to tell you something
from my heart.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.060
We really thank you

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.220
for helping us
destroy Shihou Stronghold.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.820
Everyone was actually very happy
about your arrival

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.340
and willing to accept you.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.060
But...

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.540
I still feel unhappy

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.660
because Liu Pitang

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.460
killed so many of my brothers
and sisters.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.580
I feel...

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.109
I really feel useless.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.300
Xinrou.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.300
You're drunk,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.660
have a strawberry.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.340
Don't worry.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.980
I promise, I won't let him live.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.660
- Really?
- Really.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.700
I'll take you somewhere.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.700
Let's go.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:19.170
(Treasure Pavilion)

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.220
Hurry up.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.100
Hey.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.100
Why did you bring me here?

00:11:42.857 --> 00:11:44.195
(Account book)

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.460
Found it.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.860
Oh.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.700
This big gold bracelet.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.940
One for you, one for me.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.940
Don't take it without my permission.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.220
Wasn't there something missing inside?

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.060
Missing what?

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.300
Seems like a few account books
are missing.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.420
That's not important.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.189
(Not important?
Those account books are all evidence.)

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.820
(How can it be unimportant?)

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.660
(Look at her expression,)

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.109
(she really doesn't know.)

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.060
Actually, I have a secret
I want to tell you,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.820
but I never figured out how to say it.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.540
I think when two people are together,
they should be honest with each other.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.420
Actually, I don't belong here either.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.509
(I'm just a medicine apprentice
who can even mispick herbs.)

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.069
(Once when I went up the mountain
to collect herbs,)

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.420
(I accidentally ate
a poisonous mushroom.)

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.220
(When I woke up, I was here.)

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.060
So I'm just like you,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.389
also

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.709
a

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.229
modern

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.060
person.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.620
