00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.380
Li Chengyu.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.429
These people are here to save you.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.960
And none of them will get away with it!

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.580
Let's get started.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:31.189
(Order)

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.580
Execute him!

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:20.010
(Huaikang Gate)

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.749
Stop! Stop it!

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.460
Here comes His Majesty's decree!

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.940
Hyah!

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.540
"As the General God of War, Li Chengyu

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.380
has concealed his identity

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.829
for a secret operation

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.540
on my command.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.829
Today marks the end of the operation.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.669
The Sword of God of War
shall be returned to him

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.229
and his true identity

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.940
shall be reinstated."

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.820
Release the arrow! Shoot!

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.210
(Huaikang Gate)

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.380
Cold Tiger!

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.860
Cold Tiger!

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.940
Retreat!

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.540
Cold Tiger!

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.820
Cold Tiger!

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.940
Chengyu.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.660
You took that arrow for me.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.260
Now I've taken all these arrows for you.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.620
Well, Chengyu,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.620
you forbid me to cry,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.940
so I'm not going to cry now.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.940
I don't fear death.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.540
So don't cry, Chengyu.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.820
It turns out you're a general.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.100
No wonder I always found you brilliant.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.189
I'm proud

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.149
to have a general

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940
as my brother.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.820
I'm taking you to the capital,
so you can be an official.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.940
I can't wait until then.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.980
Cold Tiger!

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.509
I don't care.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.189
I'm going to stay
at Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.589
It is my home,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.149
and you are my brother.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.709
Bark!

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.820
Woof!

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.269
Well,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.469
Chengyu,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.029
aren't you going to let me tag along?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.540
I'll come again when I'm free.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.060
The Sword of God of War

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.740
slays warlords

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.149
and eradicates traitors.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.269
(General.)

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.940
(Hand over evidence
of the Chancellor's rebellion)

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.100
(and Chen Xinrou shall be captured.)

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.420
What's with all those bones, Cold Tiger?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.829
It's an honor.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.509
Since you own many,
let me have one of them.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.980
I can't simply do that.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.620
Here.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.740
I've been wearing this for years,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.740
so it's got my smell.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.980
How was it?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.380
The body has been buried.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.980
Cold Tiger was sloven.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.740
So make sure his tomb looks nice.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.189
Yes, sir.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.420
Go on.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.820
Are you all right, General?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.500
What's the matter?

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.589
His Majesty sent me here

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.620
to help you out.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.420
After Minister Li Aotian took over,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.420
I returned to the palace.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.980
Has Minister Li been away all this time?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.620
Why are you in this state?

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.180
Li Aotian?

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.260
Chengyu.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.420
Chengyu!

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.269
Are you all right?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.469
What's happened?

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.820
Why are you injured?

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.060
Minister Li, why are you...

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.300
It's a long story.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.100
His Majesty ordered me
to come and help Chengyu.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.309
But it's been a tough journey.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.380
Upon my arrival in the city,
I learned about Chengyu's injury.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.620
That's why I rushed here.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.820
Are you all right, Chengyu?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.940
Aotian.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.980
What's exactly going on here?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.100
I managed to have an audience
with His Majesty in the capital.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.469
He wanted me to come and help you.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.180
After all, we're brothers.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.949
Yet I ran into some problems
on my way here.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.260
I ended up having a fight in the woods

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.740
and getting injured.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.180
Thus, the delay.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.380
Come to think of it,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.749
perhaps the Chancellor
purposely did that

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.660
to stop us from seeing each other.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.620
Then what's with the evidence
that was sent back to the palace?

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.100
Why did the Chancellor
end up getting convicted?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.820
I have no idea.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.820
Weren't you the one
who investigated it?

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.860
Anyway, congratulations
on your achievement.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.740
No way.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.180
I must take Xinrou back to the capital
and clear things up.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.540
I'll come with you.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.980
Aotian!

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.580
Looks like I've run out of strength.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.260
I always end up
holding you back, Chengyu.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.860
I'm sorry.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.260
Forget it.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.980
Too much has happened today.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.780
You should get some rest.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.620
Guard.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.220
Help Minister Li back to his quarters.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.780
Please spare me, General!

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.909
Who is the mastermind?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.380
Speak!

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.500
I don't know.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.460
I really don't know.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.620
How smart of you.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.140
You know keeping quiet
won't get you killed.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.260
Keep an eye on him!

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.380
Please spare me, General!

00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:48.822
(County Office)

00:09:48.876 --> 00:09:50.506
(Come to think of it,)

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.629
(perhaps the Chancellor
purposely did that)

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.380
(to stop us from seeing each other.)

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.620
(But the evidence submitted clearly
showed the Chancellor was innocent.)

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.389
(As long as it was him,)

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.909
(the truth didn't matter.)

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.780
(Could it be him?)

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.549
What are you doing?

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.389
I'm here to kill you!

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.500
Have you lost your mind?

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.149
You got our leader thrown in jail.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.620
You tricked us!

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.549
I can't explain everything right now.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.989
But you have to trust me.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.909
I never meant to harm Xinrou.
On the contrary, I'm trying to save her.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.860
Then what are you waiting for?

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.100
Xinrou is the Chancellor's daughter.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.740
She's been jailed for treason.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.980
If I break her out now,

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.380
it'll only show she's guilty.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.869
Tomorrow,
I'll take her back to the capital

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.220
and testify for her.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.980
I'll let you visit her,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.980
so you'll know she's safe.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.740
Leader!

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.460
Xinrou!

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.389
Xinrou!

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.149
Minmin.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.869
You must've been starving for days.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.669
Here, I made you
your favorite pastries.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.220
Sit down and try some.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.269
I'm tired of this flavor.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.860
Make me something new after this.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.620
Xinrou.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.900
Are you...

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.549
Here's some incense.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.900
It drives away insects.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.340
Take it, Xinrou.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.749
I'm not afraid of bugs.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.580
I even catch them for medicine.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.380
Got it?

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.389
By the way, Xinrou,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.909
they say you're
the Chancellor's daughter

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.100
and tied to the treason case.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.380
Is that true?

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.740
I don't know either.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.080
Years ago, I fell into the river
and lost my memory.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.480
When I came around, I was already
at the Shihou Stronghold.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.900
Maybe I really am
the Chancellor's daughter.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.860
Oh, right, where's Manyue?

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.380
Minister Li.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.740
Who are you?

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.140
Have you really forgotten me?

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.900
I know your whole family was wronged.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.620
I can get you out of here,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.580
but you must work for me.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.780
So it was you.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.509
I knew you'd remember me.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.980
You saved me from this very prison

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.780
and had someone tattoo this mark then.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.989
You then sent me to Qingfeng Stronghold

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.500
to be your messenger.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.380
Though we only met once,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.789
I will never forget

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.580
your kindness.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.749
Miss.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.860
It's a cold and damp night.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.620
You wouldn't want to catch a chill.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.620
I was only carrying out
His Majesty's orders.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.100
By the way,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.740
did you help Chengyu
at Qingfeng Stronghold?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.380
I feel ashamed.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.629
Aside from delivering messages,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.500
I couldn't help him much.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.740
May I ask if Chen Xinrou
really took part in the rebellion?

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.340
Minister Li.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.860
Your cough has gotten worse.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.100
I'll search for the best physician
to cure you.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.789
She hasn't sent word
since she left for the capital.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.140
We've sent her a letter.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.380
Let's hope she's safe and sound.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.980
Protect yourself.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.700
But this thing ensures your safety.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.740
Put it on.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.980
Where's Li Chengyu?

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.740
He...

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.900
Reporting!

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.869
General.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.980
Sir.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.389
Chen Xinrou has poisoned the jailer.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.020
She said she'd kill the jailer
unless she sees you, General.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.100
