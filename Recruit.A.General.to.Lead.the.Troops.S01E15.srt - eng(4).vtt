00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.190
He and I just met by chance.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.239
I happened to be poisoned,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.990
and he cured me, that's all.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.550
Yes, I know.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.239
Now that you're cured...

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.910
I'm not leaving just yet.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.870
I'm being hunted.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.310
I feel safer here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.839
Since you're here, Miss Dongfang,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.550
stay as long as you like.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.110
If you need anything, just ask.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.550
Brother, looks like
the wind is shifting.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.230
That Dongfang girl really is something.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.550
I was jealous of you just now.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.150
But now...

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.439
You'll need a new name.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.150
Call yourself "Utter Failure."

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.279
"When fair maidens abound,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.790
gentlemen seek them out."

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.999
But too many fair maidens make it so hard...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.270
Alright, enough.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.159
Oh, right.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.270
Brother.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.510
Why were you looking for Dongfang Shan?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.910
You mentioned an arrowhead.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.359
What arrowhead?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.710
Show me.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.350
Here.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.159
Oh-ho!

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.790
I made this one!

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.519
You made it?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.359
Brother.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.999
You like collecting arrowheads?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.359
I have plenty more back home.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.359
Why didn't you say so?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.350
I'll bring you a bunch! Heh.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.430
Hold on.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.639
I didn't actually make it.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.750
It was forged at Shihou Stronghold.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.999
Last year Liu Pitang got some wild idea,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.599
and had us forge
weapons from blueprints.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.910
The whole place was
filled with smoke and chaos.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.510
(So Liu Pitang was
secretly forging weapons.)

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.679
(That means Liu Pitang is Li Fang.)

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.750
(No, wait.)

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.239
Where did they stash the weapons?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.479
Oh.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.910
No idea.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.279
Liu Pitang

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.159
never let me near any weapon business.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.719
But aren't you the Second Boss?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.790
He handled everything in secret.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.310
I knew something was off,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.350
so I kept my eyes open.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.750
What did you see?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.350
I found out that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.230
Liu Pitang secretly
hauled the weapons away.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.679
Where to?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.590
Oh, that I don't know either.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.319
Do you even have a brain?

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.839
Mm.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.070
No wonder Liu Pitang wants you dead.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.510
Why?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.999
You know his biggest secret.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.390
Why would he let you live?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.230
I guess I really am doomed.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.590
Boss!

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.670
Boss!

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.159
What's with all the panic?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.759
What's going on?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.070
Li Chengyu.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.999
What is it?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.999
Li Chengyu

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.310
invited you to Shihou Stronghold.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.039
Why would he do that?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.350
He just asked if you dare to come.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.999
Asking if I dare?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.159
I'll go.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.790
I'll go.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.559
Of course I'll go.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.230
Go?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.999
Go round up some men for me.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.599
But...

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.750
Shouldn't we report this
to the Magistrate first?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.759
A waste of time.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.350
Why bother him
with something so trivial?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.559
I'll meet that pretty boy myself.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.630
Roll out.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.390
Hey.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.950
Mind your hygiene.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.950
Try to act civilized.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.470
Brother.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.350
Brother, tea's ready.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.830
Mr. Liu.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.999
Take a look at my resort here.
Any thoughts?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.470
Much better than
your shabby Shihou Stronghold.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.590
There is a reason for every visit.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.999
So tell me, why invite me to bathe?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.590
Plotting something, aren't you?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.270
We're friends, aren't we?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.439
Dongfang Shan already
told me everything.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.790
What?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.879
Don't get worked up.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.039
Come, sit.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.950
Have some tea, calm your nerves.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.150
She told you everything?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.679
Drink.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.350
Or do you think I poisoned it?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.039
Mr. Liu, this is bold of you.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.710
You have the guts to come here.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.710
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.910
You think I came here alone?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.950
Listen up.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.799
The place is surrounded by my men.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.119
If anything happens to me,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.390
they will storm in right away.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.710
So I doubt you'll try anything funny.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.950
Though I have to admit,
I do feel a little itchy.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.039
We might as well enjoy the bath.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.590
Hahaha!

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.070
Well, how can I refuse such hospitality?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.470
The tea's poisoned.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.479
I poisoned it.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.470
The poison you used...

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.879
Talk.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.470
Where are the weapons stashed?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.230
Speak!

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.630
I'll tell...

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.239
Hey, Brother.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.039
Did you forget?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.590
The poison you asked me to use
prevents him from talking.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.830
Do you know who I am?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.470
Get out of my way!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.830
Keep an eye on them.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.510
Liu Pitang.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.070
How about we play a little game?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.439
My brother taught me one.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.719
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.710
Loser goes under for five seconds.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.270
Come on. Rock, Paper, Scissors!

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.999
You lost.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.719
Down for five.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.070
Be good. Go on.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.279
Without the Boss's order,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.470
no one goes in.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.070
Who's barking out there?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.470
Well, County Magistrate.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.559
What brings you here today?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.679
Insolence!

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.790
How dare you speak to the County
Magistrate with such insolence!

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.239
Kneel!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.590
I can kneel.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.030
Ask him if he dares to accept it.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.710
I received a report

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.070
that you, Li Chengyu,
abducted Mr. Liu.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.559
County Magistrate,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.470
I did have some issues
with Mr. Liu before,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.830
but that's all settled now.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.599
I have no reason to seize him.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.470
Then let us search inside and settle it.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.919
Search?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.950
Don't you dare!

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.470
County Magistrate,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.150
I run an honest business.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.830
You can't accuse me for no reason.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.750
Are you defying authority?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.830
I can let you go in and search.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.710
But if you don't find anything,
then what?

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.830
Ridiculous. Do you expect me
to apologize to you?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.710
I wouldn't mind that.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.350
Go! Search!

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.670
Get working!

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.199
If I don't find him today,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.359
I'll kneel to you

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.959
and offer a formal apology.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.959
But if I do find him,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.750
I'll be taking your head.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.070
Let's go.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.830
Be thorough!
Leave no corner unchecked!

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.550
- Nothing.
- Nothing here.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.310
Nothing found, Sir.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.359
Watch the blind spots.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.319
Check them thoroughly.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.839
Since we're here, County Magistrate,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.350
the search should be properly done.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.830
You haven't checked the pool yet.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.310
Let's go.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.230
Sir.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.839
Take a close look.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.070
See whether there's anyone in the water.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.599
Brother!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.119
Hey!

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.470
Cold Tiger, how can you be so careless?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.359
Ouch!

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.319
You're soaking wet.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.750
Who did this?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.710
Why don't we go search somewhere else?

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.710
Count yourself lucky, kid.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.110
Move.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.310
Have some tea before you go.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.830
And don't forget to apologize.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.350
These mechanisms
by Dongfang Shan really work.

00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:07.719
(County Office)

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.879
Sir, we searched everywhere.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.350
No sign of Mr. Liu.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.070
What should we do?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.110
Why didn't you
report to me before acting?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.119
Liu Pitang went on his own,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.590
ruining my plan.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.070
Now Li Chengyu has
followed Dongfang Shan to a lead,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.550
and they've detained Liu Pitang.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.470
Useless fools!

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.830
Sir, what should we do now?

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.479
Keep watch on both strongholds.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.119
I want to know their every move.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.350
Yes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.190
Pretty boy,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.350
why not just give me a clean death?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.870
A clean death would be too kind.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.550
I'll make you wish you were dead.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.959
Move.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.190
Wait!

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.350
I'll talk.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.470
I'll talk!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.070
I'll confess everything.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.870
Start talking.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.470
Where did you hide the weapons?

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.950
All of them were shipped to the capital.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.839
I stashed a small batch

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.199
in a cave.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.079
A cave?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.519
There are plenty of caves.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.830
Which one?

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.190
I can take you there.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.399
I can take you there,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.470
but...

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.070
I can only take you alone.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.519
Why is that?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.350
Did I say I was tagging along?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.999
This is it.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.950
Come on.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.950
Fine.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.550
Cold Tiger.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.999
Am I still your brother?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.190
Brother, what are you on about?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.670
Looks like it's time
I told you my true identity.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.950
And what would that be?

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:26.317
(General)

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.590
Brother!

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.999
So you're a big shot!

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.519
Yeah.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.119
Oh man!

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.239
That's a huge piece of gold!

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.190
You can't read?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.470
(General)
What does it say?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.590
Gen...

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.239
You only read the ones you know?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.430
Yeah.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.479
Take it.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.479
For me?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.999
Follow me and Liu Pitang.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.190
Don't let him spot you.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.719
If anything happens,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.879
take this piece of gold...

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.399
Take this badge

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.950
and find the Li family in the capital.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.950
Cold Tiger, stop him!

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.950
Why did you come in?

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.319
Didn't you tell me to come in?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.359
I told you to block him!

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.550
Oh, I couldn't stop him.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:40.879
Li Chengyu!

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.950
Tiger!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.839
You're dead!

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.150
