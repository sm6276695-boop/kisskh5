=Episode 18=

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.550
Was I wrong?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.150
Because of me,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.510
Dongfang Shan is dead,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.670
and Cold Tiger's been caught.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.430
If I keep digging,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.150
how many more people
will get caught up in this?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.270
Am I really just a tiny stone powerless

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.150
to move this mighty river?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270
Will it just swallow me whole?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.990
Well done.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.879
You're not completely useless.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270
Stay out of sight from now on.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.910
Thank you, Mysterious Sir.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.270
I'll take my leave now.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.159
Sir, why don't we just destroy

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.150
the evidence Dongfang Shan had?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.910
Destroy it?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.350
That would be a waste.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.510
I just need to tweak it a bit,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.150
and the evidence will point
to the Chancellor.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.030
If we say Li Chengyu discovered it,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.190
His Majesty would have no reason
not to believe.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.670
What is our next step then?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.159
Once His Majesty gets that evidence,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.950
the Chancellor's treason
will be a sure thing.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.030
All we have to do now
is capture Chen Xinrou,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.750
then their fates will be sealed.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.719
Our priority

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.039
is to get Li Chengyu.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.959
I have big plans.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.070
We can't let him ruin my plans.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.279
Sir, Li Chengyu gives me

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.599
a headache.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.559
He's too strong.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
We've tried every trick but to no avail.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.399
Didn't you catch one of his men?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.630
Do you need me

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.350
to show you how to get it done?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.790
Like trapping a turtle in a jar.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.159
Your Majesty,
Minister Li presented the evidence.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.510
These two arrowheads
were made by Li Fang.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.590
In his will, Li Fang said

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.719
he forged weapons

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.719
at the Chancellor's orders
at Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.670
intending to rebel.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.070
Good.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.230
Send immediate orders to detain

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.559
and interrogate the Chancellor.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.790
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.159
Deliver this imperial decree

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.510
to wherever Li Chengyu is at once.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.670
General,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190
when the prefectural magistrate
was around,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.599
I had no choice.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.439
The bodies were still there.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.399
I had to keep up appearances.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.439
Otherwise, it would be suspicious.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.559
Even with
the prefectural magistrate gone,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.159
I must ensure my own safety.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.999
That's why

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.279
I brought you here today,
to discuss how to handle Cold Tiger.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.559
He's accused

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.390
of murder.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.910
By law, he is to be executed.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.879
I have two ways

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.359
to handle this.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.879
First,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.879
you reveal your identity
to the prefectural magistrate.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.719
If you're truly a general,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.070
killing one man is no big deal.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.150
The other option is...

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.230
to trade a life for a life.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.070
Chengyu,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.950
you came to save me...

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.950
So this is what you mean

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.479
by "discuss"?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.599
He's a person, not some beast!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.070
General Li, you know how it is.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.590
I can't refuse

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.150
the prefectural magistrate's orders.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.719
See? As soon as the magistrate left,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.039
I brought you here

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.950
to take your subordinate away.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.590
Release him! Now!

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.710
Men.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.130
- Cold Tiger...
- Chengyu...

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.039
You've suffered.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.470
Not really.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.590
Can I go back now?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.950
I came to save you.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.150
Of course, I'll get you out of here.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.599
All right.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.750
Let's go.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.159
Let's go...

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.390
Let's go home...

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.999
Make sure he's secured.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.070
Make it tight.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.679
Chengyu!

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.590
Chengyu, what's going on?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.590
Let him go!

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.710
Why are you tying him up?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.119
Please!

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.719
Please let him go!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.919
Let Chengyu go!

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.999
Let him go!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.270
Cold Tiger.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.030
Chengyu...

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.150
What's going on?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.239
Why did he tie you up?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.390
Cold Tiger.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.150
Stop crying.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.270
You're not a little girl.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.239
You won't get a wife like this.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.390
Do you understand?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.999
Why did they make you take my place?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.479
I'm not leaving.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.910
Cold Tiger.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.470
I'm investigating them.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.390
I'm bluffing them.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.470
This is the only way
we can get to the truth.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.350
I'm giving you a task.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.470
Go back to Qingfeng Stronghold

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.950
and protect it.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.559
Go.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.830
Why did they tie you up...

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.150
Go, Cold Tiger.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.919
I won't...

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.350
Go!

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.590
Are you sure you'll be all right?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.790
I'll wait for you
at Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.710
Li Chengyu, Li Chengyu,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.350
you're finally in my hands!

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.390
Isn't this just what you wanted?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.359
I never thought

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.350
you'd be so loyal.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.559
You'd actually let yourself
be chained up

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.950
for one of your men.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.830
I should have killed you immediately,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.230
but you're too useful alive.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.919
I won't let you die so easily.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.390
Li Chengyu.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.350
I'm going to make sure you suffer!

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.999
Sir.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.119
Be careful how far you push it.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.839
Don't kill him

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.359
before we catch Chen Xinrou.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.230
Understood.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.230
I've already ordered my men
to search the holiday resort.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.359
I'll need a reason

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.879
to shut down

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.399
Qingfeng Stronghold too.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.319
Good.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.999
Oh, right.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.550
What about the female bandits, sir?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.870
Handle them however you want.
All I care about is Chen Xinrou.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.479
Sir,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.999
everything is ready.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.350
Tomorrow, we move on to Qingfeng
Stronghold to capture Chen Xinrou.

00:09:11.692 --> 00:09:16.655
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:21.092
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.160
Sir!

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.479
What are you panicking about?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.800
Sir, we can't get into Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.200
Chen Xinrou and her people
have the place completely sealed off.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.440
Our leader is dead,
and we can't take a single step inside.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.479
Order our men to retreat.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.719
Spread the word

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.879
that tomorrow's the day
they behead Li Chengyu.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.710
Yes, sir.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.710
I'm sure that will get

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.710
Chen Xinrou to show up.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.842
(Notice)

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.079
Look!

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.350
Come see this new notice!

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:09.842
(Notice)

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.417
(Notice)

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.350
The odds are unclear.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.750
I want to save him.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.639
Leader, think this through carefully.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.950
He's now a wanted criminal.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.310
Saving him means
the end of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.399
Either we fail the rescue
and he's executed on the spot,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.950
or we spend
the rest of our lives on the run.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.990
Leader.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.950
I trust your judgment.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.710
Me too.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.950
I may not know much,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.479
but Chengyu is definitely not

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.399
the heinous criminal
the county magistrate

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.350
is making him out to be.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.999
He doesn't deserve to die.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.759
I think this is just a false charge
made up by the county magistrate

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.870
to get rid of Yulang.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.350
Sir.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.590
Everything for tomorrow's ambush is set.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.759
If Chen Xinrou and her group
dare show up,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.590
they won't leave alive.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.950
They're going to execute him.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.710
They're going to execute him.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.110
We're limited in numbers.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.470
To succeed,

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.350
we have to outsmart them.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.350
Tomorrow, the southeast wind will blow.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.590
Erniang,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.310
find a tower in the northwest corner
and scatter flower petals there.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.470
The petals will be coated with poison.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.950
This will help knock out
most of those at the scene.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.190
I'll go to the capital to verify
the arrest warrant's authenticity.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.599
See if any higher official
can intervene to save Li Chengyu.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.479
Minmin,
prepare the carriages for a getaway

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.399
outside the city.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.470
Got it.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.550
Lianxin, Cold Tiger, and I
will spread out

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.350
around the execution ground,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.990
ready to launch the rescue

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.310
at any moment.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.599
They're all just commoners.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.310
There are no officials here.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.950
Li Chengyu,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.759
the people coming to save you
are all right here.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.070
No one's getting away!

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.479
It is the hour of Wu.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.350
Execute him!

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:48.280
