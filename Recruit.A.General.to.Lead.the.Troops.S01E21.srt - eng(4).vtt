00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.900
Li Aotian!

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.189
Perfect timing, Chengyu.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.709
News from the capital.
The Chancellor has taken his own life.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.060
What?

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.349
We need to figure out

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.980
something.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420
Got it.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.140
Where are you going?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.580
None of your business.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.580
Are you going to find Chen Xinrou?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.949
Don't you get it?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.980
Now that things have come to this point,
she doesn't matter anymore.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.149
She does.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.900
She matters more than anyone else.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.260
Xinrou!

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.060
Xinrou!

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.900
If you're gone...

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.069
Chengyu.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.980
It's too late.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.429
Chen Xinrou is dead.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.349
So are the Chancellor

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.980
and his followers.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.629
If we join forces,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.340
no one can match us.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.709
Chengyu.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.900
I'm your brother.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.700
Let's stage a rebellion together.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.189
Then this world
will belong to our family!

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.980
I don't care to whom this world belong.
I don't want it!

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.429
Yet if anything happens to Xinrou,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.220
I'll make you pay with your life.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.900
Well done.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.220
Chen Xinrou is gone for good.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.500
Since you like me,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.429
you must remember

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.060
to always back me up.

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:47.280
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.500
(Chen Xinrou is dead.)

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.780
(Qingfeng Stronghold
is having a grand funeral,)

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.020
(and no outsiders are allowed.)

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.660
(But you can access it.)

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.500
I've betrayed them.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.620
Since you've chosen this path,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.180
don't ever try
to be considerate of them.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.780
Do me this one last favor.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.460
Once the task is dealt with,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.380
I'll marry you.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.500
(Help me get rid of)

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.340
(Li Chengyu.)

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.060
I knew it were you.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.580
I'm sorry.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.340
I was left with no choice.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.060
And I'm done with making choices.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.269
Did you know that Tao Lianxin

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.700
gave Xinrou a life-saving hairpin
when she was in jail?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.940
Put it on.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.260
Did you know she could've stabbed you

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.340
(when you were poisoning her?)

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.789
Did you know
she'd rather suffer to death

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.140
(than killing you with that hairpin?)

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.940
She trusted you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.700
and treated you so well.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.060
Yet you did that to her.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.380
She will not rest in peace.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.580
Guards.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.700
Get them out of here.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.140
It was you.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.460
How come it was you?

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.060
Li Chengyu.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.220
Li Chengyu!

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.260
It turned out it was you.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.940
I'm sorry.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.780
Li Chengyu!

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.789
That useless Qin Manyue,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.380
what's taking her so long?

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.900
She's failed it for sure.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.380
Chengyu.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.140
Since you're not going to join my side,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.700
that makes us enemies.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.380
Instead of fighting a war,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.020
I should just get rid of you now.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.020
Hang in there, Xinrou.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.109
We're on the way to the medical hall,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.349
so hang in there.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.500
We're almost there.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.940
Let's go home.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.140
The antidote is there.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.700
I'm sorry.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.060
Don't cry.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.100
I'm sorry, Leader.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.580
It's all right.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.940
I don't blame you for that.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.700
It's all right.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.340
Leader.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.420
I'd like to have a word with General Li.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.700
Thank you for saving my life then.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.220
I saved your life?

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.300
Looks like you don't remember it.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.340
Five years ago, my family and I
almost got killed in jail.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.700
It was you who saved me,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.980
not Li Aotian.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.700
It was dark in there,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.740
so I couldn't see your face clearly.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.100
I only remember there was a man
who took the blows for me.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.700
General.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.340
You got the two scars on your back

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.220
from having saved me.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.300
After that, Li Aotian was looking
for someone to work for him in jail.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.700
I actually mistook him for my savior.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.860
All these years,
I've loved the wrong man

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.700
and committed those grave mistakes.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.100
Now there's no turning back for me.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.220
Erniang was right.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.420
Fate plays tricks on us.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.300
General.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.820
My life belongs to you.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.580
If you want it,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.580
just take it.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.540
Since Xinrou has spared your life,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.340
I will do the same.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.700
Leave now.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.980
General.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.100
General.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.460
You've broken everyone's trust.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.300
You're a sinner.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.100
That's all the more reason to live.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.580
You shall repent
and atone for your sins.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.060
I never expected her
to try to poison me to death.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.060
Take the decoction.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.820
And I never thought

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.700
I'd get to witness my own funeral.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.700
Luckily, I sealed your blood in time

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.700
to stop the poison from spreading.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.640
Otherwise, the funeral would've
become a reality.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.100
Antidote...

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.820
Where's the antidote?

00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:53.460
Where's the antidote?

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.460
I'm sorry.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.340
I lied to you.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.060
Actually, there's no antidote to it.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.820
Li Chengyu.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.740
Forgive me.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.060
I...

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.100
I just want to spend more time with you.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.580
And...

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.940
And I'd like to tell you a secret.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.220
I'm actually from the modern world.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.300
So are you.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.540
I know.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.940
You knew it all along?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.340
Since I was a kid,

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.580
I always hoped a great hero in armor
would appear,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.580
(charging into battle for me.)

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.580
Until

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.340
you showed up.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.860
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.700
I'm just afraid

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.700
that once I die,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.940
I'll never see you again.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.700
If I hadn't almost lost my life,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.940
you still wouldn't
have told me the truth.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.540
Li Aotian and the Chancellor
are sworn enemies at court.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.460
He's been recruiting troops
and stockpiling arms for long.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.360
He even incited
the Vice Minister of War to rebel.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.940
When that failed,

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.940
he tried to pin the blame
on the Chancellor

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.460
so as to get rid of his rivals.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.100
You were just one of his pawns.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.469
It just so happened

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.980
you became his excuse
to frame the Chancellor.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.940
Manyue had always
been loyal to Li Aotian.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.700
Both of us fell for the same poison.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.580
So that's how it is.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.220
On the day of the palace coup,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.940
the real Li Chengyu
was probably already poisoned to death.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.060
That's why I showed up.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.460
Speaking of which,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.580
let me give you some good news.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.949
I know how to cure

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.700
your poison now.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.869
For real?

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.180
Mm.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.700
I knew nothing about its ingredients,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.700
so I had no idea how to cure it.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.700
Having experienced it myself,
I know the way now.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.382
