(County Office)

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.390
Sir.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.479
Well, Mysterious Sir...

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.590
Mysterious Sir.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.230
We couldn't find Dongfang Shan.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.559
And Li Chengyu is still alive.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.199
Li Chengyu is still alive?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.830
And you couldn't locate Dongfang Shan?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.510
What's the use of having you around?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319
Please have mercy on me, sir!

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.190
Please spare my life, Mysterious Sir!

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.270
I bet you're almost recovered.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.790
Your decoction is nothing but nourishing.
I'm always energetic.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.990
You're glib.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.750
Xinrou.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.750
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.790
You've suffered these days.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.190
I thought you weren't aware of that.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.510
You were forced
to take in the other woman

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.350
and put up
with Liu Pitang's haughtiness.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.950
Of course you'd feel wronged.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.159
(Above all, I actually suspected you were
helping Chancellor to stage a rebellion.)

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.670
I felt wronged

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.910
not because of Dongfang Shan
and Liu Pitang.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.510
I knew you took in Dongfang Shan
due to the investigation.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.030
And I was aware Li Pitang's fate
was beyond your control.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.670
It's just that...

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.310
It's just that you never
told me anything.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.510
It's complicated.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.070
Once everything is over,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.590
I'll tell you about it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.510
Well, promise me,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.310
don't do Qingfeng Stronghold harm
no matter what.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.910
Don't

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.790
hurt yourself too.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.590
Sure, you have my word.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.670
General Li.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.350
Try this liquor.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.110
(Liquor)
It's definitely a nice one.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.110
What an unexpected visit,
County Magistrate.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.759
Why? Are you here to mess with me?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.510
You're jesting.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.679
At first, I really had no idea
you're a general.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.719
Pardon me for that.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.039
You're also the owner of a resort.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.399
There are opportunities
for us to collaborate after this.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.150
Let's get rich together.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.390
You felt sorry for not knowing
that I'm a general.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.950
Yet you had Liu go to Qingfeng Stronghold
to catch me two days ago.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.559
That's a double standard.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.879
That wasn't my idea.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.599
Don't... Don't get me wrong.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.999
I just helped Liu

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.470
to take over Mr. Qian's winery.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.679
I was trying to gain something
out of that.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.599
Oh my!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.039
Who would have thought
he'd be an ingrate by turning against you

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.479
and sowing discord among us?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.070
He really deserves death!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.719
He does deserve death.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.070
Where's his body?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.039
Well, don't worry.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.999
I've had my men search the entire city.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.710
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.119
Today, not only am I here
to apologize to you,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.470
but I'd also like to ask you for a favor.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.950
The prefectural magistrate

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.239
is visiting this small town soon.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.590
And he'd like to hold a banquet

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.070
at some unique inn.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.830
Having given it a thought,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.599
I think our holiday resort
is the most unique of all.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.879
You need the support
of these local officials

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.350
to make your business bloom.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.039
Since you hold a high position,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.270
naturally, you have no idea
about the way of survival here.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.999
Suit yourself.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.590
I'm done eating. Please excuse me.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.590
And take back
that stupid liquor of yours.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.039
That's great news!

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.390
You shouldn't say no to it.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.790
If the prefectural magistrate
has a high praise of it,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.070
our business will prosper for sure.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.150
I think that cunning official
is up to no good.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.710
Well, if he's cunning,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.390
he'll just order you

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.799
to give him a special banquet.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.559
Solve that issue

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.390
and he won't find fault with you.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.590
I don't think that'll work.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.039
My goodness. Go ask Manyue.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.510
She's full of peculiar ideas.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.710
Go on.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.350
Fine.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.390
Didn't I forbid you to send letters?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.710
I only listen to Minister Li.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.239
I'll explain myself to him.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.150
You'd ruin my plan.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.710
Besides, do you think I'll do you harm?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.150
Isn't Minister Li your brother?

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.270
What's the big deal
with sending him a letter?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.070
I see, Minister Li is Li Aotian.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.150
Who else could it be?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.470
You do listen to him, huh?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.590
From now on,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.390
I only do as Minister Li says.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.710
Back then, my father was
a trivial official in the capital.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.510
He made a reckless mistake,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.710
(and our family ended up in jail.)

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.590
Someone paid to have your life taken!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.679
(Someone was jealous of my father
because of his influential status.)

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.390
(So they wanted to kill us all in jail.)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.070
(Minister Li took that blow)

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.150
(and saved my life.)

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.390
Guards.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.070
Get these bodies out of here!

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.390
If it weren't for him, I would've...

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.150
Do you fancy him?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.110
Well, does he know you like him?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.190
Minister Li is always occupied.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.430
He doesn't have time for me.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.830
Come on, it's all right.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.950
To my surprise, you're lovesick.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.710
Fine. If there's a chance,
I'll matchmake you two.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.990
Just buy me a meal
when you're together.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.310
I have an idea about the banquet.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.710
Is this the surprise
you got me, County Magistrate?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.710
Sir.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.470
Pardon me...

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.239
Perhaps Mr. Li has forgotten
about the banquet

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.470
due to his busy schedule.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.830
Gosh, I'm not here
for mountain climbing.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.759
With your incompetence,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.479
you might as well resign
and do pig farming.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.879
My God! Please calm down, sir!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.350
Let me check on it.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.730
(House of Joy)

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.470
Mr. Li.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.959
Have you forgotten about

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.110
the prefectural magistrate's
banquet here?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.230
Prefectural Magistrate.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.239
Patient.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.199
I've got you a surprise in there.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.719
Come, let's go check it out.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.710
Please.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.550
This way, please, sir.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.719
Ready, go!

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.750
Welcome!

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.359
Isn't this a bathhouse?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.710
There's nothing special about it.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.479
Prefectural Magistrate.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.599
This is no ordinary official banquet.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.399
The highlight is the hot springs here.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.479
You get to have a foot soak

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.959
while enjoying delicious food.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.310
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.879
Doesn't that sound interesting?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.519
Well, that sounds great.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.110
Nice one!

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.070
Visit this place often
and you'll find it fun.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.839
I too find that interesting.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.959
Well, please be seated.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.190
Don't just stand here.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.470
Chengyu.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.110
Chengyu.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.870
What's going on?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.310
Let's go...

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.310
Help!

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.750
Prefectural Magistrate.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.950
Come here!

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.990
Look!

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.350
There's a body in the hot spring.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.359
Li Chengyu.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.310
You've really got me a big surprise!

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.950
Sir.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.870
The County Office received a report
not long ago.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.750
They said Li Chengyu forcibly brought
Dongfang Shan here to the mountain.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.239
She was nowhere to be seen since then.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.950
I also heard

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.759
that Li Chengyu tied the knot
with Dongfang Shan

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.359
in front

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.990
of everyone.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.599
I've got it figured out

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.599
now that I'm here.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.599
He tricked Dongfang Shan
into coming here

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.470
and got rid of her!

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.350
Stop feigning ignorance!

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.079
They may not know what caused
Dongfang Shan's death,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.119
but I do!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.119
Say something!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.639
I'm the county magistrate.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.710
Stop it, Li Chengyu!

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.479
You killed this lady here.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.239
Are you going
to kill an imperial official

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.599
in front of us all?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.119
County magistrate, my foot!

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.639
You're going against my order here.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.359
How lawless of you!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.079
What are you waiting for?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.079
Catch this murderer!

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.599
Chengyu!

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.199
Cold Tiger!

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.239
Don't kill him!

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.110
This has nothing to do with you.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.119
I killed her.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.470
I did!

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.430
Just catch me.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.719
Arrest me.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.990
- What are you doing, Cold Tiger?
- Chengyu.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.950
This woman was being disobedient,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.950
so I killed her.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.070
I threw the body into the water.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.599
But I never thought it'd float.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.639
I killed her.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.759
I did that.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.399
Just catch me.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.639
Here, arrest him.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.759
As long as I'm around,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.959
no one can catch him!

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.759
This is a trap, Chengyu.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.190
Don't fall for it.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.830
Chengyu.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.350
They won't stop
until they get one of us.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.750
The resort has just opened.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.750
It can't do without you.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.350
You can get me

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.230
out of jail.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.879
I wouldn't be able to do anything

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.190
if you were jailed.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.750
Chengyu.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.990
I'll wait for you.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.750
Just catch me!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.190
Prefectural Magistrate.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.110
Let's head back too.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.710
Let's go...

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.230
What was that?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.710
