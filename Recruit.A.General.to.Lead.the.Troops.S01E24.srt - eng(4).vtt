=Episode 24=

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.260
Your Majesty.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.020
I don't want to stay in the capital.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.180
What do you mean?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.900
I don't want to be an official anymore.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.340
I just want
to stay at Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.580
I'll give Chen Xinrou a grand wedding

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.580
and live a worry-free life
with my family.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.220
That would be enough for me.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.540
Wouldn't it be better
to stay by my side?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.140
Li Aotian committed treason.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.200
That crime means
the annihilation of the whole clan.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.900
Even if I capture him,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.540
do you think the ministers
would trust me to keep you close?

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340
It's too late.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.700
What do you mean?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.780
By His Majesty's order,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.980
these three women are guilty of treason.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.260
Execute them on the spot.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.300
You've got this all planned out
all along.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.060
If you'd been good
and stayed by my side,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.220
I could have given you glory and wealth.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.060
But since you insist on leaving,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.780
you can't blame me for being merciless.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.740
Truth be told,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.900
I've already sent my men
to capture Chen Xinrou and the others.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.500
You make me look like a fool!

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.389
You can't blame me for this.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.749
Now you're the General God of War.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.520
You're powerful enough
to make me feel threatened.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.780
How could I possibly keep you?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.500
Did you know why I've always
called you Little Rock?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.149
How impressive of you, Brother Li.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.149
Your Highness.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.589
You're the future emperor,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.429
so you should stop calling me brother.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.429
But I'll always be the rock in your hand.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.269
I'll strike

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.429
wherever you want me to.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.340
Great! Let's have another round.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.709
But now,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.989
this rock has grown bigger

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.300
and bigger.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.989
I fear some day I'll lift it up

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.580
only to crush my own foot!

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.149
Listen here.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.620
There are no brothers
in the imperial family.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.180
There's only power.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.620
To secure my throne,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.740
I can only sacrifice your clan.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.660
Chengyu.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.620
You still don't get it.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.900
Serving an emperor
is like being with a tiger.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.989
When you hold the highest position,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.140
there's no way to live in peace.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.340
Li Aotian was right.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.900
The higher the power,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.900
the more sacrifices it demands.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.700
Both Li Aotian and I bear the Li name.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.220
It makes sense
that you want to get rid of me.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.460
But what wrong did we commit?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.900
I put my heart
into finding you evidence.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.669
I treated you as my brother.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.340
What did you see me as?

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.820
Fine.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.900
You can have my life.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.940
Will you let them live instead?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.340
Please keep your word.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.340
I'll drink the poison.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.340
You must guarantee their safety.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.700
Permission granted.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.260
(From now on,)

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.940
(the General God of War, Li Chengyu,)

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.340
(shall cease to exist.)

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.989
(You once saved my life.)

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.709
(Well,)

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.789
(we're brothers.)

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.560
(I saved your life,
yet you threw me in prison.)

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.349
How low of you!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.340
You'll secretly infiltrate
Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.549
Chen Xinrou

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.029
is ferocious and merciless.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.709
It's you.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.340
Chen Xinrou.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.260
What if I said I liked you?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.140
Stay.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.340
Can I trust you?

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.580
Yes.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.020
(Chen Xinrou.)

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.780
(Goodbye.)

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:41.245
(Thirty years later)

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.589
Back then, during the court rebellion,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.349
the General God of War, Li Chengyu,
risked his life

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.229
to uncover evidence of treason
and uphold justice,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.780
perishing together with Li Aotian.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.320
General Li dedicated his life
to the nation and the people.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.940
His military achievements were unmatched,
making him an eternal legend.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.869
(Thirty years have passed.)

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.580
(The Qingfeng Stronghold he once stayed in
is now Qingfeng Manor.)

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.349
(It's thriving)

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.340
(under the management
of two ladies.)

00:08:47.930 --> 00:09:00.160
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.882
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:54.220
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.980
It's time to wake up

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.940
from this dream of glory.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.460
Yes, it's time to wake up from it.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.989
This patient had alcohol
during his bath,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.700
causing alcohol poisoning.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.509
Our latest medical equipment

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.229
can stimulate his brain nerves

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.060
to speed up recovery.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.920
The woman next door, Ms. Chen,
was poisoned by mushrooms.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.349
They share one machine.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.509
Both of them

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.829
still haven't come round.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.229
If this goes on,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.940
it'll get dangerous.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.420
Wait, you're awake.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.749
Where am I?

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.069
You're in hospital.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.860
Do you remember what happened?

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.460
Where's the patient here?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.700
She's gone.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.580
I know you've been dutiful.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.180
I was being inconsiderate then.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.580
You've worked hard.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.980
So have you.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.580
It hasn't been easy for either of us.
