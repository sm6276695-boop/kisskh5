00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.909
General Li, I entered Qingfeng Stronghold
only to deliver a message.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.389
I've never done anything else.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.549
You have no proof

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.709
accusing me of forging evidence
against the Leader.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.380
Is this inappropriate?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.389
I'm only speculating,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.469
not certain.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.980
Look how flustered you are.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.909
Of course, you're the best
at bookkeeping.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.229
I can keep accounts,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.509
but I can't alter the records.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.860
You can check.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.109
No need, I trust you.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.100
You wouldn't wade into this mess.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.429
Then do you know

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.940
about this arrow?

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.069
How come

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.460
he's giving hairpins to someone else?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.140
I don't know.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.220
Think it over carefully.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.260
I've never seen it.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.149
(Minister Li,)

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.789
(today, General Li came to
Qingfeng Stronghold to investigate.)

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.909
(He suspected treason,)

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.540
(but it was confirmed to be a false
accusation against Chen Xinrou.)

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.900
(Hereby notified.)

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.895
(Qian's Winery)

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.429
(Tavern)
Qian.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.429
Young Master Li.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.549
Where's Li Aotian?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.349
Who?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.500
Oh,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.549
that new steward you hired.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.869
Where is he?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.149
He left after two days,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.700
said something about family matters,
so I let him go.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.140
What's wrong, Young Master Li?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.520
Did he mess something up?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.269
I can immediately get someone else
to handle it.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.069
No need.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.540
No need.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.340
Where are you rushing off to?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.549
Hahaha, Young Master Li,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.300
this is all thanks to you.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.389
You set up this Qingfeng Group,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.780
and now my reputation
in the county has skyrocketed.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.869
When the county magistrate heard
business was booming lately,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.149
he decided to host a banquet,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.429
inviting all of us shopkeepers to join.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.029
Hahaha, oh my,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.709
it's getting late,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.100
I should be going.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.780
Young Master Li,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.900
why don't you come with me?

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.989
Think about it,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.029
you're out alone, and it's not convenient
to reveal your identity.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.229
If you come with me,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.060
I can introduce you to the magistrate,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.229
so it'll be easier

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.149
to handle matters in the future.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.500
Right?

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.060
Let's go then.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:57.745
(County Office)

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.580
Please, come in.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.429
Mr. Qian, you arrived early.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.389
Have a seat, Mr. Qian.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.589
Mr. Zhang.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.149
I don't know what's up
with my Akhal-Teke horse,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.549
it's moving unusually slow today.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.429
Could it be because it's from
the Western Regions?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.180
A precious horse like that
can't handle city roads, I guess.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.300
No idea what's wrong.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.549
My wrist has been aching lately,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.180
I should see the doctor

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.620
once I get home.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.660
If I had known it'd be
this kind of crowd,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.340
I wouldn't have come at all.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.149
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.780
Your Excellency!

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.869
Mr. Qian.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.389
Your Excellency, I am Li...

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.389
Did you bring your servant?

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.620
No, this...

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.469
Mr. Qian,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.060
you really treat your servant well.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.949
By our rules,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.869
a servant

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.749
shouldn't attend a banquet
with their master.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.669
No.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.749
You don't know,
this is Young Master Li, Li Chengyu.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.589
Today's banquet

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.949
is to celebrate the court's
elimination of my greatest trouble,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.180
Shihou Stronghold.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.780
Also, thanks for supporting
our county business.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.340
Your contributions
are truly appreciated.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.549
Especially you three,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.780
you are the pillars of this county.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.669
I will continue to rely on you
in the future.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.589
Ah, understood.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.549
Your Excellency.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.340
Here,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.789
I offer a toast to you all.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.940
Good.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.580
Thank you, Your Excellency.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.780
A toast to you all.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.460
Everyone, please sit.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.589
Ah, right.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.940
On this trip north,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.349
I managed to acquire
some rare treasures.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.000
I'd like to present them
for your enjoyment.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.869
Ah, um...

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.380
Please don't mind them.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.029
Here.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.869
Your Excellency,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.589
this is for you.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.469
Oh!

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.109
This is yours.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.580
Thank you.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.989
Mr. Qian.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.109
Good.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.709
Thank you.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.669
I didn't expect

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.029
Mr. Li to also be here today.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.140
Ah, this...

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.109
Nothing left.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.029
Really, my apologies.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.349
No problem.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.140
Mr. Zhang, your trip north...

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.589
Your Excellency,
this crispy duck is truly delicious.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.140
Here, cheers!

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.989
Your Excellency,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.140
have a drink.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.349
(After all, my identity
must not be revealed easily.)

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.320
(Maybe keeping the magistrate
will be useful later.)

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.789
Drink.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.140
Eat.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.349
Not bad.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.780
Come, drink.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.220
Your Excellency,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.789
all of you shopkeepers,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.229
I am Li Chengyu,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.869
newly arrived,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.989
and unfamiliar with the rules.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.380
I hope you will kindly look after me.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.500
I first offer a toast.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.589
Come, Mr. Zhang.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.589
Here.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.060
Come.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.020
Mr. Zhang.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.820
Your Excellency,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.380
all you shopkeepers,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.349
I, Li Chengyu, newly arrived,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.700
do not understand the rules.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.789
I ask for your guidance in the future.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.140
I offer another toast.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.669
This crispy duck is quite good.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.429
Delicious.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.900
Bring three more.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.140
Your Excellency,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.580
I offer you another toast.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.340
Your Excellency.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.700
Li Chengyu,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.349
what are you trying to do?

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.820
So you're not deaf, huh?

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.589
Coming from the countryside,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.700
unfamiliar with rules,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.740
you dare to cause a scene
at the magistrate's banquet?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.380
Do you not wish to live?

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.380
Young Master Li, you...

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.700
Capture him for me!

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.549
Your Excellency, he can't be arrested!

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.549
Young master Li

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.669
actually knows high-ranking officials
from the capital.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.140
Who cares who he is?

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.340
Seize him!

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.029
Your Excellency.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.780
Are you alright?

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.789
Who is this brat?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.669
So audacious.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.380
He is the husband of Chen Xinrou,
the leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.229
A live-in husband, right?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.060
Daring to act wildly in front of me!

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.869
I won't let him off.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.882
(Qian's Winery)

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.460
Mr. Qian.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.940
Keep this safe.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.709
You must never mention

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.700
that I took your goods.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.229
Mr. Qian, why in the past few days

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.580
has no one been ordering
from Qingfeng Stronghold?

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.380
Because of General Li...

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.940
Young Master Li.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.580
He offended the magistrate,

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.989
and so the order came down,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.229
no shopkeepers may buy goods
from Qingfeng Group anymore.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.789
You know they are officials.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.149
I'm just a merchant.
If blame falls on me,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.020
I can't even protect myself.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.109
Please bear with me.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.700
Please, bear with me.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.500
Chengyu,
Xinrou isn't happy either lately.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.340
She hasn't gone out at all.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.149
It seems the Qingfeng Group
is also in trouble.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.700
No one dares place orders for our goods.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.580
What do you think we should do?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.860
Boss, the chief constable
and a few officers have barged in.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.420
The magistrate ordered
a search of the mountain.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.509
Remove everything
from Shihou Stronghold.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.869
No outsiders are allowed in.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.300
Stop the music.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.509
What's this? Your land? Just searching?

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.709
This is Qingfeng Stronghold's land.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.629
Searching here now is breaking
into private property.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.100
Do you know the law?

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.069
Obstructing official duties.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.420
Be careful, or I'll throw you in jail.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.820
Do you have the guts for that?

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.940
I am the only chief constable
in this city.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.820
Tiger!

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.460
Beat him up!

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.229
Think carefully, I am the only
chief constable in the city.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.460
Ah ha!

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.180
What should we do?

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.349
They're coming to give us trouble too.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.389
You and Xinrou aren't handling anything.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.949
At this rate,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.940
how can our business survive?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.580
Alright.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.300
I'll think of a plan.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.740
Selling buns!

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.100
(Qingfeng Bobo Shop)
Look at our big meat buns!

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.100
Why me?

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.509
Hey.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.709
Don't you want to help
your Qingfeng Stronghold sisters?

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.940
Be good.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.989
I want to.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.860
Have you memorized your lines?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.060
Good.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.749
Hey everyone, don't miss this.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.589
Take a look over here.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.749
Check it out.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.460
Don't miss it!

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.109
Welcome everyone to Qingfeng Bobo Shop!

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.949
Qingfeng Bobo Shop.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.709
Today,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.580
everyone is here at last.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.229
Qingfeng brand Osmanthus Fine Wine,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.340
(Hahaha, has everyone seen this?)
recognize it, Qingfeng brand sale!

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.109
Usually, if you buy one jar
of this wine,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.300
it costs 20 taels of silver.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.349
That's right, today,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.589
no middlemen,

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.229
no resale markup,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.749
just come to Qingfeng Bobo Shop,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.589
and it's only 19 taels.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.740
How much?

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.340
Too expensive!

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.340
Too expensive, 19 taels!

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.349
Nineteen taels?
I don't even want to buy it.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.980
It's only one tael cheaper than usual.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.109
Then...

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.940
What do you suggest we do?

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.700
You let everyone decide.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.540
Nineteen taels is still expensive,

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.460
make it nine taels and nine.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.869
Nine taels and nine?
Why don't you rush to grab it?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.220
Exactly.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.589
Forget it.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.189
First, let everyone
see the quality of our wine.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.340
Exactly.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.100
Smells wonderful.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.540
Sweet and refreshing.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.540
So satisfying!

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.509
I won't allow

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.109
no one's ever tasted such good wine!

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.949
Exactly, come on.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.069
Today, I'm drinking
from the smallest jar.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.589
Today, all jars, big or small, are only

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.949
nine taels and nine.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.349
What? Not possible?

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.629
No, stop messing around!

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.469
Ignore me, today this jar sells
for nine taels and nine.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.949
At worst, I'll quit tomorrow.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.940
Everyone, it's time to race
for your jars!

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.949
Today, everything is nine taels
and nine.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.869
Come on, everyone, three, two, one, go!

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.109
- Grab it!
- No!

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.460
- Don't come over!
- Hurry and grab! I'll block her.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.940
Come on!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.709
Don't rush.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.940
Don't panic.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.220
Take it easy.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.589
Who stepped on my shoe?

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.189
I haven't grabbed mine yet.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.629
Exactly! Is there any wine left?

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.420
How can they do business
with this little stock?

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.389
Everyone, haha!

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.989
I didn't expect such enthusiasm.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.869
I only prepared this much at first,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.989
but seeing everyone so enthusiastic,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.300
I'll bring out another batch.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.940
Hey, Li,

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.060
this time we really can't sell
for nine taels and nine.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.109
We'd be losing out.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.589
Hey, no raising prices.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.829
If you dare raise it,

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.460
I'll report you to the county office.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.189
Everyone,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.420
calm down.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.420
Seeing everyone so enthusiastic,

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.869
we'll still sell
for nine taels and nine.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.229
At worst, I'll quit tomorrow.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.100
No!

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.069
What should we do?

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.349
Don't grab it.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.980
Don't grab it!

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.300
Everyone, don't grab it!

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.700
Don't grab it.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.060
Boss, your plan works!

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.349
Keep an eye here.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.460
I'm going to get some water.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.980
I need to pee too.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.509
I said it.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.700
I don't know anything
about account book.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.860
Liu Pitang!

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.820
I entrusted you with
the important task of forging weapons,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.180
yet you can't even handle
a small Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.629
Now you've put yourself
in this situation.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.940
You almost ruined my big plan.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.469
Please spare me, Sir!

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.420
I know I was wrong.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.589
I beg you.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.180
Give me one more chance.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.980
One more chance.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.940
I'll give you the last chance.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.309
Thank you.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.869
Thank you, Mysterious Sir.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.869
Thank you, mysterious sir.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.189

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.189

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.589
Li Chengyu's business
is getting better and better.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.109
What do you think about this?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.100
What?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.389
Go and take down his stall for me.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.300
- Go now!
- Yes, I'll go right away.
