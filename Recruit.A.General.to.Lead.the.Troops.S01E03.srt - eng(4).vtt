00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.220
What did you give me to eat?

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.020
Poison.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.220
You gave me poison?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.789
Li Chengyu,
you had better tell the truth.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.949
Tell the truth about what?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.869
Explain it!

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.660
If you don't, how can I admit anything?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.309
Tell me who you really are.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.469
And what is your connection to Mr. Qian?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.780
And the fire at stronghold, was it you?

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.709
I am just an ordinary farmer
from the foot of the mountain.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.869
I have long admired Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.000
and wished to see it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.789
I never thought that
once I climbed the mountain,

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.800
I would become your husband
to guard the stronghold.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860
It was also
my first time meeting Mr. Qian.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.269
Perhaps because of my good looks,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.780
we became close at once.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.269
As for the fire,
it could never have been me.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.069
Now Qingfeng Stronghold is my home.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.980
How could I burn down my own home?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.500
You said you were an undercover spy.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.980
Undercover?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.620
Good heavens!

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.500
That's a local saying from my place.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.220
A dialect, you understand?

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.420
That fire really wasn't my doing.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.620
But I can give you a clue.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.349
You should check the firewood shed.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.629
There are many empty wine jars
for wedding feasts,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.149
all stained with oil.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.540
And discarded fire sticks nearby.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.269
Who delivered the wine that day?

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.060
I think you should
know better than I do.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.260
About the fire, I believe you.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.980
As for Mr. Qian,
it doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.340
Then you can wait for death.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.500
Hey, wait!

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.060
All right.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.469
Within three days,
I will give you an answer.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.149
For the sake of my own life,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.220
I must handle this properly.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.820
Deal.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.500
When I find the evidence,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.060
let's see how arrogant you are then.

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:34.429
(Qian's Winery)

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.469
Where is your Mr. Qian?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.460
We are here to discuss
a business deal with him.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.429
The shopkeeper is not in.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.429
Well then,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.949
I will decide.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.100
Not in?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.969
So Mr. Qian isn't here? Let's go.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.949
Stop talking nonsense.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.500
Don't you want the antidote?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.749
Guards.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.020
Yes!

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.100
What's going on?

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.389
If you ruin this business deal,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.869
can you bear the responsibility?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.900
Beware, or your master
will hold you to account.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.900
Where is he?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.060
Where is the man I told you to capture?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.469
There are still three days left
on the deadline.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.709
If you arrest him now,
it would be unjustified.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.180
People would only laugh at us,
wouldn't they?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.620
Once the three days are up, we will go up
the mountain and seize him at once,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.460
and deliver him to Shihou Stronghold.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.780
Very well.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.869
I will give you three more days.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.340
If you succeed,
you will be well rewarded.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.820
But if you fail,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.340
you know what I am capable of.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.500
Good.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.900
I shall give you one chance.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.340
But in our winery, there is a rule.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.300
Inside the winery,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.340
wine comes first.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.180
You drink a bowl of wine,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.900
then say a word.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.060
What, have you lost your nerve?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.700
Don't forget,
in two days your delivery is due.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.260
Trash will always be trash.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.820
Spineless.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.140
At this rate,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.340
you might as well send your leader
Chen Xinrou to talk to me.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.909
A dog that only bullies the weak.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.460
Why bother with him?

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.109
Wait until their master returns.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.429
Forget two days,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.780
you'd wait thirty.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.589
Men really are unreliable.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.349
Fine.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.789
If you won't drink,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.500
I will drink and you speak.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.260
Deliver.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.820
Goods.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.940

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.500
Door.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.460
Tch,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.140
truly a useless waste.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.789
You even let a woman drink for you.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.940
Oh, right.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.349
What did you say earlier?

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.469
Women doing business?

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.349
They should hurry home
to marry and have children.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.220
Everyone in their stronghold
is unwanted.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.109
Even the leader
was a man taken by force,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.469
a live-in husband.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.549
What a disgrace.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.140
Haha...

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.380
Deliver.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.620

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.820
To.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.380
Door.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.580
What did you say?

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.789
I didn't hear you.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.349
Are you deaf?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.260
You...

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.549
Stop drinking.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.380
Can't you see they did it on purpose?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.060
Stay out of it.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.669
What kind of man bullies women?

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.789
I will drink.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.140
I will drink one jar
and speak ten words.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.700
Fine.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.580

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.869
We receive the pigeon,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.469
and deliver to the door.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.940
Do you understand?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.709
No.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.260
You...

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.580

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.460

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.620
Let go of him!

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.589
Let go of him!

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.900
Go and apologise.

I was foolish,

when I was bullied before,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.940
I wanted to smash a wine jar
over their heads.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.940
Today I finally did it.
