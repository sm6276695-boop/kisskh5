=Recruit A General to Lead the Troops=

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.887
=Episode 7=

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.860
There is still one more person.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.060
(One more person is a spy.)

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.540
I never thought Li Chengyu
would be such a man.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.069
Leader.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.749
What should we do?

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.580
Kill him.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.300
Refine the heart.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.740
First, close down
his Yuchang Hot Springs.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.629
Let us see what he really intends.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.640
I worked day and night for this day.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.789
This afternoon they will choose
the Best Stronghold Member.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.820
And she shut down my hot spring.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.820
Is that not clearly aimed at me?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.749
Is it because I am a man?

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.460
Men are people too.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.860
Chengyu.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.780
Come here.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.789
What is it?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.869
Chengyu.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.069
Do not be angry.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.620
Leader did it for your own good.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.780
Peacock?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.620
Treasure Pavilion?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.780
I understand.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.780
Understand what?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.540
Report.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.620
Brother.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.340
You are my brother.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.349
How many times have I told you

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.260
not to disturb me when I am eating?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.620
Speak.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.549
Brother.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.260
I was discovered by Qingfeng Stronghold
and nearly lost my life.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.429
I kept running along
the edge of the well.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.260
I found that the well connects
to the river of Li Village.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.309
We cannot get into Qingfeng's well,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.820
but we can start
from Li Village's river.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.900
Poison

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.220
the river.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.780
Put

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.060
poison in.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.149
But Brother,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.660
the people of Li Village...

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.060
As long as Qingfeng Stronghold
is destroyed,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.780
what does it matter
if a whole village dies?

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.460
Poison it for me.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.940
Poison it all.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.900
Hurry.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.380
Go. All right.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.149
(Tenth Best Stronghold Member
Selection and Awards)

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.989
Today is the Best Stronghold
Member Award.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.229
According to tradition,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.109
the one who has contributed the most
to the stronghold in the past thirty days

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.460
will be chosen
as the Best Stronghold Member

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.900
with the chance to enter
the Treasure Pavilion and select a gift.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.900
(This Best Stronghold Member
title is out of reach.)

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.900
(Let alone
entering the Treasure Pavilion.)

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.820
(It seems I must
find the informant first.)

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.709
(Tenth Best Stronghold Member
Selection and Awards)

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.749
I choose Li Chengyu.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.300
(As expected,
everything follows the plan.)

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.940
I think it should be Li Chengyu.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.709
Chengyu, what are you doing?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.869
Ah, sorry.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.500
The Best Stronghold Member
goes to Li Chengyu.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.269
Ha, the weather is cold.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.780
Wear something warm.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.900
Many thanks.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.940
Well, I never expected
to receive this honor.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.989
I truly gave much for it.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.740
See this scar on my face?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.060
Of course.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.989
In the end,
I must thank our Leader Chen Xinrou.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.469
You should thank Manyue.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.500
She spoke many good words for you.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.040
(Tenth Best Stronghold Member
Selection and Awards)

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.820
Good, ha ha.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.770
(Treasure Pavilion)

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:41.082
(Treasure Pavilion)

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.900
Young Master Li has not been
in the stronghold long.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is his first time
entering the Treasure Pavilion.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.020
Why not let me accompany him?

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.589
Sister.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.789
I found out.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.820
Chengyu wants to enter
the Treasure Pavilion to look for Peacock.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.269
Peacock?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.349
Leader, does Li Chengyu not simply
want to enter the Treasure Pavilion?

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.709
Let him in.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.469
We will see what he wants to take

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.780
and what he intends to do.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.789
Then let Forth boss go with him.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.580
Forth Boss has a quick temper.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.380
He would argue with Li Chengyu
at the slightest word.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.900
Let me go instead.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.869
I was the one who counted the treasures
in the pavilion before.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.460
I know them well.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.580
Very well.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.260
(It seems the Emperor was right.)

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.789
(If they were not plotting rebellion,)

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.380
(how could a poor stronghold amass
so many treasures?)

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.820
Why choose me as Best Stronghold Member?

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.900
Young Master Li schemed all these days.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.260
Is it not just to enter
the Treasure Pavilion?

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.140
You may tell me what you want.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.140
Perhaps I can help you.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.140
Then I will speak plainly.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.900
I want the evidence
of your Big Boss's rebellion.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.060
Rebellion?

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.940
What is Young Master Li talking about?

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.140
This smoke is poisoned.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.140
Speak.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.260
Who sent you?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.260
So it was you.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.620
Who are you really?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.700
Friend or foe?

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.340
If foe,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.460
I would have killed you just now.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.700
If friend, not quite so either.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.060
Let us say we serve the same master.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.460
You were sent by Lord Li.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.460
(So His Majesty's surname is Li.)

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.020
Yes, he sent me.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.780
I have always kept the accounts.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.620
But I once saw the Leader
keeping other accounts.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.780
If you can find them,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.460
you should have what you want.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.260
Do not deceive me.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.820
Turn the incense burner and see.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.840
(Account books)

00:08:41.382 --> 00:08:42.732
(Account books)

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.469
(These letters match those seized)

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.460
(from the rebels.)

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.820
Since you knew all this,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.940
why not gather the evidence yourself?

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.989
The task I received

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.700
was only to report everything
in Qingfeng Stronghold to Lord Li.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.540
I know nothing else.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.180
Very well.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.349
Let's go.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.060
You cannot leave like this.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.660
They will search you.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.709
There is a secret chamber

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.460
that leads outside.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.509
Knock me out,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.469
walk away,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.220
and I will delay them.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.540
Before this mission ends,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.340
at least one of us must keep our cover.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.060
If you mean to leave,
set the items down.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.860
I will strike.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.940
What a pity Chen Xinrou is so beautiful.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.229
Leader.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.509
You let Li Chengyu
into the Treasure Pavilion.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.460
Were you testing him?

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.700
Yes.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.869
So do you not trust him

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.540
or feel nothing for him?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.460
Why ask such a thing?

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.820
Oh, I just cast lots the other day.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.700
It showed there
is some fate between you.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.989
So I thought
if you are only toying with him,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.700
then I will make my move.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.700
Though I still dislike him,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.460
the sign is said to be most accurate.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.940
Sisters, I feel so unwell.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.340
Erniang.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.180
Well now, ladies.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.820
What has happened?

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.989
We seem to have been poisoned.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.220
Poisoned?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.700
Brother, something has happened.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.709
They have all been poisoned.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.229
(Treasure Pavilion) Come out quickly.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.860
Brother.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.495
(Matchmaker Temple)

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.540
Old man, wake up.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.820
This is the evidence His Majesty needs.

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:53.245
(Three thousand taels have been divided into
five shipments and sent to Qingfeng Stronghold.)

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.340
Wait.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.109
This evidence is crucial.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.940
You must deliver it yourself.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.160
General, are you not leaving?

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.109
Why should I leave?

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.829
If I go, they will be alarmed.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.949
I must stay and steady the situation.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.180
By the way,
when will the imperial troops arrive?

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.460
In five days.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.700
Good, go then.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.460
Chen Xinrou.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.100
Chen Xinrou.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.860
Liu Pitang?

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.869
Second Brother, what should we do?

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.740
Why not turn Qingfeng Stronghold
into Shihou Stronghold?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.589
Second Brother, they are
all our brothers across from us.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.589
Otherwise we could...

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.469
Enough already.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.069
Has a donkey kicked your head?

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.509
They all want me dead.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:00.989
Brothers?

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.060
Exactly.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.660
We are part of Qingfeng Stronghold now.
We cannot betray them.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.660
(Treasure Pavilion) Follow me.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.180
Liu Pitang, what are you trying to do?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.580
Stop!

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.700
At last it is about to end.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.940
You stay.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.860
What are you staring at?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.260
(Yuchang Hot Springs) Welcome.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.180
Which one is their true self?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.709
Hey, hey.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.460
Are you all right?

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.180
Aren't you the farmer from before?

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.860
Weren't you already dead?

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.829
They did not kill me.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.340
We were taken to the back yard
and then released.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.589
The water.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.460
There is something wrong with the water.
Many in the village have died.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.060
Help me.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.540
Hey, do not die.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.940
Chen Xinrou.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.860
It has been three years.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.220
Do you know
how I lived these three years?

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.069
Every year,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.109
I thought of ways to kill you

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.060
just to ease my pain.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.300
Three years have passed,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.580
at last I found a way.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.940
Three years,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.660
three words.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.300
Eat you up!

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.069
Do you know why I like gnawing on bones?

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.220
Ah?

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.220
Two words.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.060
To practice.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.109
Practicing how to eat you
so I can take revenge.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.700
Of course,
I will not let you die so easily.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.460
I will take you back
to Shihou Stronghold,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.220
and make you bear
a dozen little Tangtangs.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.860
When you are old and withered,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.349
I will strangle your neck with my hands,

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.060
and crush your guts.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.869
When I tighten around your throat,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.109
the whole world will fall silent.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.580
Bah!

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.709
Then I will kick you into the pot,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.869
and boil you

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.580
for forty-nine days.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.349
Then share you with all our brothers,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.709
a bowl for each.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.709
Good!

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.060
So our brothers

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.100
can also taste the flavour of victory!

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.700
Chen Xinrou,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.100
whether you accept it or not,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.629
this is your fate.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.989
So,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.869
please,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.709
with a smile,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.869
accept your fate.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.500
