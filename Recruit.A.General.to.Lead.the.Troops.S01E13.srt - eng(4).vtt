=Episode 13=

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.750
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.039
(Looks like
the Chancellor is losing patience.)

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.270
(We need to move quickly.)

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.710
Did the Chancellor
really plot a rebellion?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.070
If he didn't,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.150
then who's the one framing him?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.150
But if he truly is plotting a rebellion,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.479
does Xinrou know about it?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.790
You said you were looking into evidence
proving Chen Xinrou's innocence.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.799
His Majesty is pressing
hard for answers.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.870
Have you found anything yet?

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.879
The Chancellor is the Chancellor.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.750
Xinrou is Xinrou.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.270
Even if the Chancellor really did rebel,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.990
that doesn't mean
Xinrou had any part in it.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.150
But if the Chancellor is innocent,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.350
and Xinrou truly knows nothing...

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.990
Why was the evidence planted on her

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.350
to frame her?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.910
Could this arrowhead, like the letters,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.270
be something Xinrou had no idea about?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.550
Rebels forged this arrowhead
through Dongfang Shan.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.279
Could Dongfang Shan know

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.150
who's really behind all this?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.230
If we want to keep digging,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.790
finding Dongfang Shan is the key.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.230
Leader.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.910
If you don't know
how to explain it to him,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.150
then let me do it.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.910
Forget it.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.510
I'll tell him myself.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.990
Yulang.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.110
I know you
and the Leader share feelings.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.679
Even though she and I
were brought together by fate,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.910
but if you truly like the Leader,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.670
I'm not the kind of woman to be petty.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.399
But I've noticed

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.310
that something seems off
between you and the Leader.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.070
Maybe that too is fate.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.070
Perhaps you two
just aren't meant to be.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.590
Why not try believing in fate for once?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.750
I'm not forcing you, though.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.559
Sister Erniang!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.750
Your kitchen's on fire!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.999
(Fire?)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.630
(Got it!)

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.350
You all heard that.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.950
Oh dear...

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.790
There's nothing we can't talk about.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.719
Leader, I just want to ask.
Do you actually like Yulang?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.879
As long as you nod,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.790
I, Qiu Erniang,
won't even hesitate to withdraw.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.670
I...

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.070
Yes, I do like him.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.310
Ah, so it's true.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.999
Then, what's wrong?
Did you two have a quarrel?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.479
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.750
Li Chengyu came to ask me something.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.679
The Leader mistook it

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.350
as him giving me something.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.999
But the truth is, he was in trouble.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.910
He needed a thousand taels of silver.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.590
A thousand? That's no small problem.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.470
No wonder Chengyu's been
drinking and brooding lately.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.879
So that's what's been troubling him.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.999
Sisters,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.790
we have to help him.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.350
He really stopped at nothing to see you.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.950
He even burned down his own house.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.350
And I gave you poison,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.070
so now his life is
the price for the antidote.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.039
Brother!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.119
There it is!

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.359
(Wanhua House)
My buddy saw Dongfang Shan

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.140
go in yesterday
and never came back out.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.119
He must still be inside.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.470
Are you sure?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.510
Brother!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.159
You really mean
to take me into a brothel?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.910
I've never been in one my whole life!

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.710
Brother!

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.719
If the Boss finds out,
won't she claw at you?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.599
- Haha!
- Get lost!

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.239
Stay here.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.119
Hey!

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.039
Brother, you're not taking me in?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.950
You're not taking me in?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.239
You're not taking me in?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.830
Fine! Next time I'll come by myself!

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.950
(So this is a brothel,
just like in the novels.)

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.559
Ah, Young Master Li,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.359
my mistress has been
waiting for you upstairs.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.350
- She sent me to fetch you.
- You know who I am?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.150
Of course.
She sent me to fetch you herself.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.150
This way, Young Master Li.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.070
Where is Mr. Dongfang?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.470
I've long heard of your name.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.390
And now seeing you in person,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.599
you truly are impressive.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.950
Miss Dongfang?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.039
Miss Dongfang.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.470
You greeted me with a hidden weapon
as soon as we met.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.470
Isn't that a bit much?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.950
You jest, Young Master.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.919
All these girls here

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.150
are my welcome gift to you.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.710
I only hope
the hospitality isn't lacking.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.470
Send them all away.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.910
You alone are enough.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.710
Go.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.510
You knew I was coming.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.590
Of course.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.599
Last night,
my estate suddenly caught fire.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.599
Every place I could live in burned down.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.390
Yet not a single person was harmed.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.359
Clearly, someone wanted to see me.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.679
But this someone is just a pauper

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.910
who can't even
put together a thousand taels.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.030
Your price is outrageous.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.470
Let's speak plainly.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.710
Was this arrowhead made by you?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.910
And who ordered it?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.510
The Chancellor.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.359
But in your trade,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.879
aren't you forbidden
from revealing a client's name?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.470
Normally, yes.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.310
But for you, I can.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.350
After all, you're a general.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.710
How do you know I'm a general?

00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:14.959
(Wanhua House)

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.470
Why would Chengyu
come to a place like this?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.550
Crows are black everywhere.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.359
No man is worth trusting.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.110
And here I thought
Li Chengyu was different.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.710
Turns out I was wrong.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.519
Fate must have been blind

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.950
to send me this "good match".

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.350
Bah!

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.879
He's not that kind of man.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.710
He must have
another reason for coming here.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.239
I've heard that in the capital,
people hold meetings

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.599
right inside brothels.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.110
The crowd makes it easier to talk.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.359
And with the Leader at his side,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.870
Li Chengyu wouldn't
go after other women.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.950
Manyue, you're just
making excuses for him.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.430
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.110
Well, well.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.550
Second Boss. What a coincidence.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.070
Cold Tiger? Why are you here?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.230
Hey, let me tell you something.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.199
Say it.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.119
I like you.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.550
Get lost!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.759
Boss! Fancy seeing you here.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.399
You two came to the brothel as well?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.639
Enough nonsense. Is Li Chengyu inside?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.950
Is he there or not?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.239
No.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.550
Get lost.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.830
Let's go.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.350
I heard that you were thrown into
the imperial prison for treason.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.710
I wonder if that news is true or false.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.710
If it's true,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.190
then you must be an imposter.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.350
If it's false,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.950
then you're a fugitive
who broke out of prison.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.190
Who told you the general was in prison?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.310
Hahaha!

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.470
I've roamed the martial world for years.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.870
Naturally, I know all the tales.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.070
They say the God of War's
ultimate move, Thunderous Force,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.950
is mighty and peerless.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.710
Young Master,
why not show me one strike?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.590
That would prove who you are.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.710
I only fear that if I use it,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.350
you won't live to see it.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.070
No matter.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.550
If I'm fortunate enough to witness it...

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.230
I can die without regrets.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.950
You really are the General.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.990
Now you know.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.999
Why are you coughing blood?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.519
Hey, I didn't even use my full strength.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.870
Don't you dare pin this on me.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.950
I've been poisoned.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.310
General, save me!

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.590
Li Chengyu, you...

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.550
Manyue, tell me.
What do you think of him now?

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.199
A life is at stake.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.350
We must save her.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.399
So the thousand taels
you borrowed from Qin Manyue

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.470
were for your trip to the brothel?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.079
Don't tell me you plan
to bring this shady woman

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.470
back to the stronghold.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.119
Not Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.710
I'll take her to Shihou Stronghold.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.950
Is that even the point here?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.590
She's poisoned.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.350
I can't just send her to a clinic alone.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.950
Xinrou, help me treat her.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.950
Mysterious sir.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.310
Please, sit.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.430
Quick, serve the tea.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.710
Sir.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.310
Dongfang Shan failed to kill Li Chengyu.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.710
She was taken away.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.879
Liu Sheng, how goes the work

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.950
on stockpiling silver
and forging weapons?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.359
Sir.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.959
Using my position as shopkeeper,
I made quite a lot of silver.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.879
I've put all of it into weapon forging.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.639
Good.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.710
Now go find Dongfang Shan.
