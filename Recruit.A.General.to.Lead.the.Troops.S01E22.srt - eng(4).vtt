00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.979
Close the gate!

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.370
Hide!

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.930
Silang!

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.090
I've seen plenty of trash before,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.170
you really think this little array
can trap me?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.250
Where's Li Chengyu?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.130
Why is it so slow?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.739
Xinrou!

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.419
Li Aotian is attacking!

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.019
Lianxin is no match for him!

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.299
Wasn't he just a scholar?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.299
How is he so strong?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.979
You must finish this medicine.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.530
Otherwise, it's suicide!

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.459
Minmin, wait here.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.419
I'll go.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.019
Activate the mechanism.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.250
Xinrou.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.019
Don't worry.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.499
He won't discover me.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.410
If I can stall a little, I will.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.370
I'll wait for you.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.210
Xinrou.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.050
Stop!

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.459
Lianxin!

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.650
Chen Xinrou.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.979
It's me.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.090
You're really hard to kill,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.859
then I'll send you off again.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.650
I have evidence of your crimes.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.530
If you kill me,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.979
aren't you afraid the evidence
will one day be found

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.530
and your crimes exposed to the world?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690
What evidence could you
possibly have against me?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.530
Do you dare to bet?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.370
I have a way to make the Emperor believe

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.370
Chen Xinrou is innocent.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.579
Only I know where the evidence is,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.530
you and I must go fetch it.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.530
Let's see if you dare.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.610
I know you're clever.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.490
Don't play tricks.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.410
Why so nervous?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.970
I'm only

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.610
letting you get familiar
with the terrain.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.610
Or maybe not

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.939
what if there are traps inside?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.090
If you take another step forward

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.490
and trigger the mechanism,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.699
both of us, along with the evidence,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370
will be burned to ashes.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.930
Sharp-tongued.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.579
It's dark inside.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.850
Be careful.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.730
Where's the evidence?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.459
Where exactly is it?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.810
Why are you yelling?

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.490
Can't we walk slowly?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.370
Or you can find it yourself.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.410
Tell me now!

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.490
Then,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.730
there's an account book on the table.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.730
Go find it yourself.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.170
(Hold on within one incense stick's time,
the medicine will be ready.)

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.370
Do you know

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.370
that your father is already dead?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.730
I know.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.610
So what?

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.410
You should know

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.970
snapping your neck

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.970
is as easy as crushing an ant.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.619
I know.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.370
So what?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.050
Even if you kill me,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.730
you'll never get the evidence.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.610
Even if you take the throne,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.250
one day, someone will use
the evidence to overthrow you.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.730
You are clever indeed.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.179
What a pity.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.730
Following Li Chengyu is a waste.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.170
Why not follow me instead?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.019
What about Manyue?

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.170
She?

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.970
Just the lowly daughter of a traitor.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.410
A useless pawn.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.250
Oh right.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.610
How did you deal with her?

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.730
She had no evidence in her hands,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.899
she must be dead by now, right?

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.610
I'm not as disgusting as you.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.370
Good.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.530
Then I'll play something
even more disgusting.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.850
That coward Li Chengyu

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.050
still has to hide behind a woman.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.259
How many cuts do you think
I have to make on you

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.090
before he shows himself?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.370
Despicable.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.170
Vile.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.730
What did you say?

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.730
I said you are

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.730
despicable.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.610
Vile.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.170
You will never measure up to Li Chengyu.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.970
Because you can never stand
in the light.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.730
You're like a filthy insect,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.619
lurking in the shadows,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.850
stirring up storms.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.730
If you have the guts,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.090
then fight him openly and honorably.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.090
Even if your martial skills are high,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.970
you'll never defeat Li Chengyu.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.730
Fine.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.330
Then I'll grant your wish,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.490
kill you first,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.379
then kill Li Chengyu!

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.490
Stop!

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.899
Li Aotian!

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.259
The evidence you want is in my hands.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.570
Let Chen Xinrou go!

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.970
What skill is there in bullying a woman?

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.730
If you have guts,
come take the evidence yourself.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.570
Your poison has been neutralized.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.619
A mere little toxin is nothing to me.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.610
But you pretending to be weak
and sickly all this time,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.130
so hypocritical.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.850
Seems there was never
any so-called evidence.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.610
Why don't you kill me?

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.979
I'm not like you,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.379
addicted to killing.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.539
I'll spare your life and drag you
back to the capital

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.450
to clear Xinrou's name.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.210
You're doing all this just
for Chen Xinrou?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.570
For her alone, it's worth it.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.890
You're still as detestable
as when we were kids.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.659
Always in the spotlight,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.210
always the favored one,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.970
yet always preaching about virtue.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.970
Aren't we brothers by blood?

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.539
Do you really hate me that much?

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.730
Yes.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.499
Precisely because we share blood,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.130
I hate you.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.890
Since childhood I've been sickly
and weak,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.619
drank the bitterest medicine,

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.130
endured the harshest needles,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.770
suffered the strictest training,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.139
all just so

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.210
I could live up to the name
of a military family.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.130
I never once complained

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.730
for all that.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.890
At least our parents cared enough
to try.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.490
But once you appeared,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.450
everything changed.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.570
After I was injured,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.370
my memory hasn't been good.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.250
Can you tell me about our childhood?

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.219
Of course you don't remember,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.970
because those things
meant nothing to you.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.739
Gifted as you were,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.570
a prodigy in martial arts,

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.219
fighting alongside Father at twelve,

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.210
made a general at thirteen.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.219
When you called the Emperor "brother",

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.250
did you ever think of me,
your elder brother?

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.890
Because of you,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.370
our military family had an heir.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.490
But also because of you,

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.259
the physicians stopped treating me,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.250
Mother stopped making my medicine,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.370
and Father

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.970
never spared me a glance.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.450
I was like these fallen leaves,

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.250
decaying in some forgotten corner,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.490
slowly sinking into the dirt.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.730
No one cared.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.610
So why should I care about anything?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.379
When I seize the throne,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.970
I'll make them all remember me!

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.490
I'll make them see

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.210
titles are empty.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.259
Power,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.139
wealth,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.090
that's what matters most.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.130
I can actually understand that.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.490
Because I used to feel the same way.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.370
I remember back when I delivered food,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.730
nobody paid me any respect.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.850
When I delivered
to those luxury apartments,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.330
I wondered

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.970
why wasn't I the one living there?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.330
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.490
But now I understand.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.970
Everyone's path is different.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.090
Living well,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.330
with your loved ones safe and sound,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.730
is what truly matters.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.730
Chengyu,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.730
you still don't understand.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.770
Serving an Emperor
is like serving a tiger.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.770
As a high-ranking official,
you can never truly live at ease.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.979
Only by becoming Emperor yourself

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.890
can you control your own fate.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.610
But I don't want to be a minister,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.770
nor do I want to be Emperor.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.730
I just want, after we return
to the capital,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.210
to resign my post.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.730
The truth is, I don't remember much

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.370
about our childhood.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.610
But,

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.970
I still want to apologize
for how I was before.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.379
The first time I entered
Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.370
I truly trusted you.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.850
I saw you as my big brother.
