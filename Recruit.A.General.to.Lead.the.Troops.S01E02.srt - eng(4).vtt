(Joy)

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.629
Hey, eat this.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.669
Alright.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.709
You too. Have some of this.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.149
Oh, don't be shy.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.829
This meat is good.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.029
If I hadn't asked someone

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.580
to check the imbalance in our stronghold
that we needed a husband to balance it,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.389
I would never allow a man

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.140
to live in Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.060
After all, I hate men most.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.909
But we have no choice.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.860
Fate decides everything.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.829
Come.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.629
Sisters, today is our leader's wedding.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.869
Let's eat and drink well!

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.069
Eat and drink well!

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.189
Come, eat and drink well.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.260
Not you. You're a child.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.389
(I never thought)

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.540
(I, Li Chengyu,
would ever wear a bridal gown.)

(Ginger Peel, Hematite)

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.780
So many herbs.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.140
Chen Xinrou experiments daily.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.220
How do I contact that spy?

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.349
Okay?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.900
The spy doesn't know my plan,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.060
but they bear a unique peacock mark.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780

fierce-faced, and sharp-teethed?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.820
Those are just rumors.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.469
Qingfeng Stronghold's filled with women.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.069

Besides the four leaders,

no one has seen my true face.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.940
In other words,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.820
those who've seen my true face are dead.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.940
Everyone has two sides.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.060
What about you?

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.580
Besides being a farmer,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.820
what else are you?

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.300
(Could she know I'm an undercover?)

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.580
Tell me who sent you.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.900
(Should I just kill her now?)

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.780
Whoever you are...

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.340
if you set fire or harm
Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.780
you'll die.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.340
Fire?

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.380
Fire! Hurry and put it out!

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.429
What's going on?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.989
Darn Shihou Stronghold. Those animals.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.429
They set fire to our stronghold

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.740
on our leader's wedding night.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.869
Heaven strike them.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.180
They'll die a terrible death!

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.149
The real problem is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.620
the 500 jars promised to the winery,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.549
the 500 scarves for Yipin Hall,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.269
and 300 bottles of natural juice
for Huiyuan Pavilion are all burned.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.269
If we can't deliver in three days,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.500
we need to compensate 30,000 taels.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.340
What do we do?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.380
Tonight,
the only outsider in the stronghold

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.620
is that person.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.429
So it was arson.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.060
I thought my cover was blown.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.500
Cover?

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.180
Leader.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.580
Mr. Qian led a group
into Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.380
Lock Li Chengyu up for me.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.260
(No way you're locking me up.)

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.060
We came in good faith
to congratulate your leader.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.140
But we didn't expect

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.900
to see our goods burned.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.260
Give us an explanation.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.940
If I recall correctly,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.380
delivery is in three days.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.580
Yet you came so quickly.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.109
Do you have far-seeing eyes

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.820
or super hearing?

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.029
Or was it you who set the fire?

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.869
- Yes.
- It must be them.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.940
Definitely.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.020
What are you talking about?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.029
Why would we burn

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.580
our own goods?

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.349
Cut the nonsense.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.789
Today, either hand over the goods,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.460
pay up,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.260
or...

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.460
I can see that your stronghold

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.380
has many pretty women.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.029
You should fetch good money.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.020
Don't you dare.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.380
Our master trained in martial arts
for over 40 years.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.909
General God of War

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.589
may not even be his match,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.229
let alone a woman like you.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.260
Fine, I won't bully you.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.500
Call out your leader Chen Xinrou
to speak with me.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.940
Seems your leader isn't here.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.380
Listen up.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.700
Surround them all for me!

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.220
Surround them!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.229
I want to see

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.060
what this mysterious Chen Xinrou
looks like.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.580
Hey.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.380
Get up.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.220
Speak.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.580
Where's Chen Xinrou?

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.140
What are you doing?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.429
This is Chen Xinrou.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.500
Look at the fierce face and sharp teeth.
Exactly like the rumors say.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.140
I'm not.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.060
Hey, you...

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.220
Are you fooling me?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.700
I'll give you a chance to live today.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.380
Crawl through my crotch,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.220
and I'll spare you.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:00.269
Come to my residence
to empty the night pot at night, haha!

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.260
I'll give you take two steps.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.669
(General)

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.940
General? I'm the damn retired emperor!

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.140
Come on.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.900
I used to deliver food.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.140
I could endure it then.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.820
Now I'm a general.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.029
Even in my dream,
I won't let you bully me.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.469
What's happening here?

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.580
Huh?

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.060
What is this?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.780
Oh no.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.309
Is this General God of War's
legendary move,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.309
Thunderous Force?

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.460
Ah?

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.860
Once unleashed,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.580
dark clouds cover the city

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.940
and can repel millions of enemies.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.940
General God of War.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.109
General God of War.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.349
Forgive me, I didn't know
you were General God of War!

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.220
Forgive me, General God of War.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.060
Forget those goods outside.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.109
I'll release them right now, alright?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.300
General.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.340
No need.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.580
Qingfeng Stronghold never cheats.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.349
Isn't there still three days?
