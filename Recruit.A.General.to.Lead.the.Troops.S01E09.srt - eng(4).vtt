00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.850
=Recruit A General to lead the Troops=

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.887
=Episode 9=

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.260
Truly worthy of being Little Stone.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.580
Good.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.940
Already found the solid evidence
so quickly.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.980
I should immediately dispatch troops
to suppress the bandits.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.420
But this matter is of great importance.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.140
Only I know that Little Stone

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.340
is not in prison.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.909
Who should I send

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.580
to ensure everything goes flawlessly?

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.709
Your Majesty,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.269
in recent days,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.789
Minister Li Aotian

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.620
has knelt daily before the hall,
pleading for the general.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.220
Bound by flesh and blood,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.780
closest kin.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.060
Although Li Aotian
is naturally weak and sickly,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.540
he still comes every day to plead.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.060
Unlike the Chancellor's followers,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.420
who want the Li family gone
or avoid them.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.709
It shows that Li Aotian
is upright and principled.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.900
He can be trusted.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.220
Good.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.700
Summon Li Aotian to the audience.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.629
I will secretly send him with troops

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.420
to assist Li Chengyu
in taking Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.029
Handle them gently.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.429
These are wine jars.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.269
Treat them as you would your own lady.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.620
Handle them gently.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.029
Ahhh!

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.500
General.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.869
General, I'm really sorry.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.220
I truly appreciate you
delivering the wine in person.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.589
I heard something happened at
Qingfeng Stronghold a few days ago.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.220
Are you all right, General?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.940
You had me deliver the wine

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.429
just to see if I was all right.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.620
If I weren't,
how could I deliver the wine to you?

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.029
Yes. You are right, General.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.469
I was reckless.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.829
Please forgive me, General.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.780
Stop calling me "General" all the time.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.620
Afraid they won't know my identity?

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.340
Ah, right.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.060
Young master.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.869
Steward.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.669
Steward!

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.429
Come!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.589
Hurry, come!

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.620
Here he comes.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.989
The previous steward
was very disobedient.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.309
I already broke his leg
and kicked him out of the mansion.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.100
This is the new steward I hired.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.749
From now on, young master's goods

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.140
will be handled by him.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.060
Young master's affairs
must be well taken care of.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.340
Must be well taken care of.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.220
Alright, get busy.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.469
Alright.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.660
Gently.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.309
This is 60 taels and eight qian.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.580
Please count.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.740
Also, this is a tip from our shopkeeper.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.780
Keep it safe.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.660
(At the Matchmaker Temple)

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.780
All poisoned.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.989
I knew these women

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.660
are no match for me.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.869
Go, call a few people.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.989
We'll collect the bodies.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.669
Xinrou,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.589
I've already spread the news
about the poisoning.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.429
Absolutely natural.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.709
The people of Shihou Stronghold
will surely believe it.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.309
Mm.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.829
Once Liu Pitang
enters Qingfeng Stronghold,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.589
we'll make sure he never returns.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.780
Mm.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.460
Half of Qingfeng Stronghold's sisters
died because of Shihou Stronghold.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.780
They must pay
for this blood debt in full.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.137
Boss. You forgot, there's still a master
in Qingfeng Stronghold

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:25.549
hasn't shown up yet.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.700
Oh.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.020
Right.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.220
Also, there's a hidden coward
still not showing himself.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.229
Anyway, these women have all wilted.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.109
I refuse to believe that
Shihou Stronghold, with all its people,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.580
cannot find even one
who can handle the hidden coward.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.500
Go, gather people.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.700
Recover lost territory!

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.020
Flatten Qingfeng Stronghold!

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.269
Where is Li Chengyu?

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.909
(I wanted to call him here,)

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.260
(but Cold Tiger said
he was gone since morning.)

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.260
(Who's pretending to be spooky?)

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.380
Chengyu,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.220
big brother finally see you.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.720
Big brother?

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.620
What's wrong with you?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.820
How come you don't even recognize me?

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.269
I am your real brother,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.620
Li Aotian.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.349
(So I actually have a big brother.)

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.469
Ah.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.589
I've been under too much
work pressure recently.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.260
I remember now.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.229
Chengyu, this is...

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.220
Do you like it? It's for you.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.140
I am a civil official.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.380
It's useless for me.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.549
Seeing you safe makes me relieved.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.020
I knew you wouldn't rebel.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.260
(Ah.)

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.909
(How can General Li Chengyu)

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.220
(has such a frail brother?)

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.229
Even if you have a secret mission,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.380
you can't hide it from me.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.029
Why did you come all of a sudden?

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.269
Chengyu, our people are already
spread throughout the city.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.580
I disguised myself as a steward
hiding in the winery.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.380
I wrote you letters
in the name of Mr. Qian

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.580
just to lure you here.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.020
Guard.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.220
Your Excellency!

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.580
The rebel letters are solid evidence.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.820
The emperor has ordered,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.260
for you to lead troops
to Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.589
Capture Chen Xinrou.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.229
No.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.140
Impossible!

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.340
Charge!

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.220
Stop!

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.940
Today, I am in good mood.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.380
Search thoroughly.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.140
Search carefully.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.549
Whoever searches the most,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.789
I'll reward the most!

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.260
Good!

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.060
Search!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.869
Leader.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.589
Liu Pitang

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.820
already brought everyone
to Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.549
(Why hasn't Li Chengyu returned?)

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.900
(Has something happened?)

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.029
Good.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.580
Tell all the sisters

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.140
to be on high alert.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.029
This...

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.229
Your arrival is too sudden.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.020
I'm not ready yet.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.589
You watch tens of thousands
in battle without blinking,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.260
so what preparation do you need
for a small Qingfeng Stronghold?

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.909
I feel anxious for you.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.869
Finish early,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.469
return to the capital early to report.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.580
Restoring your reputation is important.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.460
But I...

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.709
It's getting late.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.460
You must depart quickly.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.460
As for me, due to my health,

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.620
I will stay here and wait
for your triumphant return.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.349
I...

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.780
Yes!

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.060
Wait.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.669
With so many of us,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.229
we'll surely alert them.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.709
I know Qingfeng Stronghold well.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.029
I'll scout ahead first,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.460
you wait here for my news.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.700
Yes.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.580
Don't follow me.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.460
Boss.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.420
We've been ambushed.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.180
Brother!

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.340
Brother!

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.469
Boss, there's an ambush!

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.580
Boss.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.709
Brother!

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.860
Boss.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.869
How could this happen?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.700
Boss.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.300
We've been ambushed.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.180
Fatty!

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.980
Fatty!

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.589
I've been ambushed!

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.180
Where are my men?

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.820
Where are my men?

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.060
(Why is there no one in the fort?)

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.820
Li Chengyu.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.940
I'll kill you.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.660
Ah, I...

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.420
General, what's wrong?

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.580
As expected of a general.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.700
In such a short time, a single person
has killed so many bandits.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.229
Isn't there still one left?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.989
Capture him for me.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.709
Yes.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.700
Go!

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.869
Don't move.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.949
Sir, here you go.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.540
Eat this.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.220
Move faster.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.940
Where did you go?

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.949
I thought something happened to you.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.660
They've left.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.469
I went to deliver wine to Mr. Qian.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.820
I heard people from
Shihou Stronghold have arrived.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.820
(Qingfeng Stronghold)
Hurry!

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.389
Sir, he's also a bandit.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.180
Why don't you catch him?

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.709
Do you even know who he is?

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.469
Sir, ignore his nonsense.
Take him back and interrogate properly.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.989
Use all 18 tortures.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.300
Yes.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.229
You little pretty boy.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.989
You'll meet a miserable end.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.860
You little pretty boy!

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.940
General.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.760
Why are you only catching men?

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.229
Wasn't Qingfeng Stronghold supposed
to be a women's stronghold?

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.869
Information is outdated, huh?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.989
Qingfeng Stronghold isn't
what you think it is,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.629
a bandit fort dominated by women.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.869
But Minister Li said...

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.109
What does he know?
Has he ever been here personally?

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.229
Have you been here personally?

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.980
You've been here, haven't you?

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.869
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.389
These men are the main force
of Qingfeng Stronghold.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.829
The rumors about women

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.469
were meant to trick you
into becoming slaves and soldiers.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.109
Now that you've captured them,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.349
it's already a great achievement.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.869
Take them back and claim your merit.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.829
But Minister Li said

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.420
we must capture Chen Xinrou alive.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.720
Who's the general here?
Will you obey the orders?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.629
If you don't, and something goes wrong,
how many heads will you answer with?

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.940
I dare not. Only the general's orders
are to be followed.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.869
Alright then.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.309
Take them back.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.469
I'll personally handle Chen Xinrou.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.389
Yes.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.540
Let's go.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.229
Chengyu,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.980
why did you come alone?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.180
You didn't catch Chen Xinrou?

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.460
Chen Xinrou can't be caught.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.700
Why?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.860
I suspect the evidence is flawed.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.820
What's wrong with it?

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.100
Not clear yet.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.509
But think about it,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.860
if this evidence is indeed flawed,

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.069
and we capture her,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.220
it would be like making the Emperor
misunderstand the Chancellor.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.989
Look, I'm a military man.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.829
I fight on the battlefield every day.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.589
I'm not afraid,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.740
but you're a civil official.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.180
You bow to the Chancellor
day in and day out.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.660
It wouldn't look good
if faces were torn apart.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.629
How could it?

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.229
If the truth is found,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.580
I'll personally go apologize.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.300
But this thorn is already
deeply lodged in the Chancellor's heart.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.060
The Li family will be criticized.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.709
What will the Emperor think?

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.820
We would have falsely accused
the Chancellor for no reason.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.349
Who takes the hit?

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.820
The Emperor's face,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.460
or ours?

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.940
This...

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.309
Look,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.469
today wasn't entirely fruitless.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.340
We did catch that man, right?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.629
He's also a leader.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.869
You'll take him back
for secret interrogation.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.820
I'll stay at Qingfeng Stronghold
to continue investigating.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.349
Once I find clues,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.460
I'll report to the Emperor.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.740
(Looks like he's convinced.)

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.700
But capturing Chen Xinrou
is the Emperor's order.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.420
Chengyu, this isn't your nature.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.300
You resist in every way,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.540
are there any hidden reasons?

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.309
There definitely aren't.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.980
I'm just afraid the Emperor
will misunderstand.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.740
Do you really think

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.340
the Emperor wants the truth
about the rebellion?

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.180
As long as it's the Chancellor,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.820
the truth doesn't matter.
