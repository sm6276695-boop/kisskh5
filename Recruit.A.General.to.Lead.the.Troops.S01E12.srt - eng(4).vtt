(Qingfeng Bobo Shop)

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.570
Ladies,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.330
don't you often feel like
you've got nothing to wear?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.530
Like your wardrobe is
always missing something?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.770
Well, take a look
at the one I'm wearing now.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.819
Wow, isn't this gorgeous?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.459
It's made with...

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.419
That's enough! Dismiss!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.179
Everyone move along!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299
Who let you set up a stall here?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.490
Hey!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.730
Move along!

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.979
You're gathering to trade

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.730
and blocking the road!

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.459
Officer, what's the meaning of this?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.290
What do you think it means?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.890
Did you even inform
the local authorities of your business?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.610
Setting up a stall
requires paying a fee.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.539
Everything made by Qingfeng Stronghold

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.890
has already been reported.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.059
Oh really?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.890
Then, hand over the silver.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.970
How much?

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.210
One hundred taels.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.419
A hundred taels?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539
I could buy a house for that much.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.419
You're charging me
the same just to run a stall?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.419
This is madness!

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.259
Enough talking.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.419
Pay up, or I'll smash your stall. Do it!

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.779
Wait, officers!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.139
Officers!

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.970
Out of the way!

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.979
Stop!

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.330
Who's there?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.160
Cold Tiger.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.100
Looks like I went too easy on you last time.
You dare show your face again?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.699
I...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.779
This was the county magistrate's order.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.490
It's not my choice.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.410
Sir,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.490
treating Qingfeng Stronghold and
the holiday resort this way isn't right.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.339
Take my advice,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.530
don't bring trouble on yourself.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.339
What trouble?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.539
You just keep nagging,
like some old hen clucking around.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.890
Shut it already.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.179
He's just a live-in husband.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.179
Who gave him the guts?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.490
Who gave him the nerve to go against me?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.859
I'll make sure
he learns who's in charge here.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.610
Mark my words!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.259
Li Chengyu!

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.539
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.459
Young Master Li!

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.730
Don't hit him!

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.539
How dare you defy my authority?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.859
Who gave you the guts?

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.210
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.739
Stop hitting him!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.610
I should wipe out your whole family!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.659
Guards!

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.859
Seize this madman at once!

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.450
Arrest him!

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.210
Open your dog and see!

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:47.710
(General)

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.010
General...

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.210
He's a General!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.210
You dare threaten to kill my family?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.739
Mercy, sir!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.859
Please forgive me!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.259
I didn't know you were a general.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.050
I was wrong. I swear I didn't know!

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.419
Listen.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.099
If you ever mess with Qingfeng
Stronghold or the holiday resort again,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.610
you'd better think about
whether you can keep your head.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.739
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.050
Never again.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.610
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.610
Young Master Li.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.659
Sir, you...

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.810
Ah, you really...

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.490
Young Master Li!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.730
He's a general!

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.730
Good heavens...

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.859
General Li!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.019
General Li!

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.210
General Li!

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.210
(County Office)
General Li.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.539
Don't waste your anger on him.
That county magistrate won't dare again.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.099
Would he have the guts?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.210
No, of course not.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.739
Oh, General.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.610
Isn't this something you dropped?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.450
Do you recognize it?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.099
Not exactly.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.699
Not the arrowhead itself.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.859
But the material and design
are very unusual.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.979
It doesn't look like
something from your army.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.610
It should be more powerful
than standard military issue.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.610
If you ask me, I'd say
it comes from the Dongfang family.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.930
The Dongfang family?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.659
That Dongfang family

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.859
has been famous for
designing weapons for generations.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.459
And the latest line of weapons

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.250
is said to be crafted by Dongfang Shan.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.339
Right now, every legendary weapon
in the martial world

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.810
was made by Dongfang Shan.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.859
So how can we meet him?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.099
That depends. It can be hard,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250
but it can also be easy.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.899
I'm in no mood today.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.259
Don't play word games with me.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.690
Yes, yes.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.219
The easy part is,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.219
I know where he is.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.459
The hard part?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.659
That's the tricky bit.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.659
Dongfang Shan

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.659
is arrogant by nature.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.810
To meet him,
you must meet his condition.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.259
One thousand taels.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.770
One thousand taels?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.699
For ordinary folks like us,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.459
that's an impossible amount.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.779
But for you, General,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.099
that's nothing.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.010
Hahaha!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.659
Are you going now?

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.810
General?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.370
Don't forget the silver!

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.570
Old man.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.210
Old man!

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.210
Lend me a thousand taels.
It's for an investigation.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.930
Old man!

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.859
That old one...

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.339
Li Aotian already went back.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.810
Why hasn't he returned yet?

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.659
Annals of Emperor Jin Wu

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.219
compiles the words of a hundred schools.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.099
- The Emperor commands...
- Qin Manyue?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.859
Qin Manyue!

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.250
Young Master Li, what are you doing?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.890
- Lend me a thousand taels.
- A thousand taels?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.139
I've found an important clue linked
to the evidence His Majesty asked for.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.019
I need the money
to fund my investigation.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.339
Aren't you in charge of the money?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.610
Lend me a thousand taels.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.459
A hundred taels, maybe.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.459
But a thousand is no small sum.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.010
I can't pull that much out.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.930
Do you have a thousand taels?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.690
Do you?

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.690
Forget it. Looks like I'll have to
borrow it from Mr. Qian.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.210
Manyue.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.690
That's it for today.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.890
Manyue, you...

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.570
You like him?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.490
What are you talking about?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.099
We don't share
that kind of relationship.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.539
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.330
Besides, I already
have someone in my heart.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.339
You do?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.890
We only met once by chance,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.779
and never saw each other again.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.250
All I can do is keep him in my heart.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.930
If fate allows, you'll meet again.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.690
Then, is Li Chengyu...

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.890
He came to borrow money from me.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.219
Borrow money?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.699
And not a small amount.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.010
A thousand taels.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.930
Maybe he's in some sort of trouble.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.459
(Something this serious,)

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.690
(and he didn't even ask for my help.)

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.690
(I have to find a way to help him.)

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.859
Honorable County Magistrate!

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.050
What a surprise visit.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.059
Ah, County Magistrate,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.859
if it's urgent,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.339
you could've summoned me to the office.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.699
Why come here in person?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.810
Mr. Qian...

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.650
I heard your business
has been doing quite well lately.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.739
So, did all the things I told you before

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.859
forgotten and lost in the wind?

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.059
Since you won't listen to me,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.450
I'll find someone who will
and have them take your place.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.650
You!

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.970
Mr. Qian...

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.810
Anyone here?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.810
What on earth happened?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.850
Young Master Li, are you here
to pay respects to Mr. Qian?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.979
Please, come with me.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.499
Wait, is Mr. Qian...

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.450
He passed away suddenly last night.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.530
It was so sudden,
none of us were prepared.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.459
(Old Qian had strong inner strength.)

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.050
(It was hard to even go near him.)

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.410
(He was full of energy just a few days ago,
and now suddenly dead overnight.)

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.735
(Mr. Qian Haoduo's memorial tablet)

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.459
What was Mr. Qian
up to these past few days?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.810
Anything unusual?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.970
No, nothing unusual.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.299
Yesterday he was even chatting
happily with the County Magistrate.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.090
But that very night, he dropped dead.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.459
The County Magistrate
even sent a coroner to check.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.050
It was confirmed as a sudden death.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.219
At least the County Magistrate
was kind-hearted.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.459
He arranged properties for us

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.330
so we can at least make a living.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.850
And he even appointed a new shopkeeper.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.690
I want an autopsy.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.499
No, Young Master Li!

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.619
The dead deserve respect.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.450
Let him rest in peace.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.339
Open the coffin!

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.859
No, Young Master Li!

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.859
Mr. Qian treated you well
when he was alive.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.690
How could you do this to him?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.210
Take them away.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.579
Hear me out.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.210
No! Hey!

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:50.435
(Mr. Qian Haoduo's memorial tablet)

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.939
This is the man who bought up
all our shopkeeper's property.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.650
Our new shopkeeper, Liu Sheng.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.810
Liu Sheng...

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.570
Liu Pitang.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.530
Hahahahaha!

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.930
It really is Liu Pitang!

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.619
Brother!

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.330
He's not dead!

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.910
(Mr. Qian Haoduo's memorial tablet)

00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:44.699
(Matchmaker Temple)

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.690
Old man! Old man!

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.690
Cold Tiger!

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.099
Who is this?

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.850
You, step outside.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.099
Li Aotian.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.699
Chengyu.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.339
Li Aotian.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.099
Didn't you promise me
you'd kill Liu Pitang?

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.979
Why is he still alive?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.210
What?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.050
He escaped?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.450
Wasn't he in the capital prison?

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.939
Are you sure you saw right?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.499
I saw him with my own eyes.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.850
Impossible.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.690
That's a prison overseen by the Emperor.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.330
It's heavily guarded.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.850
Unless...

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.570
Someone let him out.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.450
But aside from His Majesty,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.970
who else has that kind of power?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.690
